====== The_Awl_Inn ======
Created Thursday 06 September 2018

By using a key in the shape of a Magic Awl, or by some other planar travel, Adventurers may find themselves in **The Awl Inn** which is unsurprisingly a Xanaran's, and is of course, tended by Barstomun Strongbeard.
The following rules apply in the awl inn

* Creatures cannot be violent or commit violent acts against eachother, any attempt to commit violence is met with immediate and permanent expulsion. This effect is omniscient and will remove spells or curses that would otherwise cause patrons to be violent. No person in the Awl Inn can steal, Damage property, or impede another patron. This is a safe place
* Everything is 10 times the price listed in the Player's Handbook.
* At each dawn, everyone gets out. Only a select few are allowed to stay for more than one day in the Awl inn, and all of them have paid a hefty sum in gold.
* It costs 300 gold to exit through someone else's portal, and only with that person's permission.

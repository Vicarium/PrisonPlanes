====== Mana_Ulla ======
Created Monday 17 September 2018

**Following the events of 5854, A few Manahararahi citizens make their way toward Mana Ulla and settle there again. The ones that survive living in this place are mostly those who have experience with innate magic or the subtle shaping of magic without need for experimentation. Bards, Sorcerers, and occasional Warlocks tend to do the best here. **

	Here, Nestled among the cliffs of the Dragon Coast, within the dense jungles Dragon Forest, is the ancient home of the Manarahi from 512 to 2081. It lies abandoned now, its valuable magical properties tainted by dangerous fluctuations caused by the longstanding effects of ancient Manarahi experimentation. Magic behaves strangely here, Frequently exploding out of control. The white Alabaster and concreted cobblestones stand still, yet reinforced by the civilization's magical peak. The room in each house is larger than those in Manaharamu, and expressed far more in Kholirahi Architecture, Central Rooms with a kitchen closet, a bed room, and usually a spare room. The Curved-pyramidal roofs are used for hanging tools and food from, in lieu of electric refrigeration, A few houses still hold archaic forms of Magical refrigeration. Many homes contain the remnants of life, several of them were abrubtly left behind. Most of them are empty, either properly packed away, or long looted by lifetimes of lecherous a//dventurers//. Mana Ulla's last remaining treasure is the Magic Well that gives the town its name, said to have magical properties of its own. Mana Ulla is a treacherous place, where the last vestiges of powerful mages still echo. 
	
		**DM's Note: this place is the place for a lot of strange things. Extraplanar ties are spectacularly weak, so no demons or angels about, and there're no major connections to the underdark, if there are any at all. But this is where "Wizarding gone wrong" ends up taking the wheel. Golems? Got'em. Animated Objects? No objections. Here, Basilisks bask, and helmed horrors haunt the hollow homes. Rather importantly is the wistless and most potent occupant of the town. The Lich-Bard-Princess	**[[+Kemalabet_Brucheva]]** who spends her time composing on a mandolin. She is a Twentieth level bard of the College of Lore, and not predisposed to welcome visitors inside the Palace. She will not give up her treasure and encourages events to transpire that drive adventurers out of the town. Wayward Golems might end up heading toward a detected party, **
		
		**Even considering the length of time that has passed, Mana Ulla was once the home to many many mages of all sorts. There are secret dungeons scattered around town, two or three room affairs scattered with workbenches and paranoia. The works of Magic Long past, Valuable artifacts hidden behind secret doors and underneath well-concealed false floors. Horrid sapiences from the victims of the deranged trapped inside of either the most mundane of objects or the most beautiful works of sick artistry, left in the dark in a stable plateau of a pain they might have even gotten used to. The Scene of two neighbours, equally secretive who shared a wall to their lairs, blasted into bits by eachother when the wall collapsed, lies under two empty houses. **
		
	Mana Ulla is laid out  around Three Features. The port, the well, and the Castle. At sunset, Homonculi crone in chorus. When Adventurers rest, Frequently a Pseudodragon will begin to rummage through their things for anthing shiny. The weather tends to be dry but the not infrequent southern storms will wrack the coast and deposit intense warm ra.ins. The weather is hot but when the south wind blows it gets spectacularly humidas well, Constitution saves to avoid the heat are then made with disadvantage.  
	
	It is worth noting that the Manarahi had fishing outports all along the Dragon Coast where they could but these were rare, temporary and infrequently inhabited for long.
	

==== The Port ====
	The area around the port is sloped toward the shore, Water elementals tend to stick around the docks, but other than that,the town is nearly habitable, the only creatures that dwell here are the exaggerated sorrows of the forgotten. A cadaver Collector Wanders this western part and should be very obvious to anyone in the area. There are plenty of opportunities to hide from it and many ways to maneuver around it. The Cadaver Collector sings approximately three or four unintelligible songs as it moves around. If anyone speaks Gnomish, they are in that, and are all songs about missing home. It stops if it enters combat. This is a trap to make people drop their guard. **The catch: **//The Cadaver Collector has a Scroll case on its back, a scroll of Hero's Feast. Are they going to risk it?//
		
	Buildings are larger here than they are further inland, but silt from high seas the storms of centuries past has been deposited along the roads and 


==== The Well ====
	The area around the well is teeming with homunculi which scatter in the presence of the two stone golems that patrol the area. The very central plaza is a small, gentle hill at the top of which is the famous Magic Well. Set up at the Magic Well is a humanoid made of pink crystals with no mouth, glowing yellow eyes and sharp protrusions all over his body. He is Lokpra, a shardmind, and he sells Barrels. Lokpra seems to be fine but he is blunt, honest, does not pick up on subtle hints or hints of any kind, and he may come off as rude. For all that, he sells his barrels at 10gp. Peridoically (once a century) He journeys out to Danzuishan to buy iron. Lokpra is a Third level wizard who specializes in Transmutation. The things in the city seem to ignore him and he is immune to the effects of basilisks. Drinking the wellwater does nothing but hydrate a person. 
		Dm's Note: **Unless they drink it at least once a day for a month, It might grant them a cantrip or a charm, regardless of class. There are 43 cantrips at the time this is written. so roll that 1d43.**
		**Functionally, Lokpra is Autistic. Technically, Lokpra is an alien. He is not able to emotionally connect with other people but he wishes to do good, He is able to pick up on metaphor but rhetorical questions and social posturing just look strange to him.  **
	The wellwater is modestly valuable at 100gp a barrel, if you can get it out. This is the dragon coast after all.
	

==== The Palace ====
	The palace sits on a small escarpment, allowing it to overlook most of the city, though its front entrance faces away from the port. It is a mostly single-story building, and it is obvious from Curved fortifications that the roof was used to defend the place from threats from above. The largest room, and the first just past the atrium, is the throne room. Behind that is the treasure room, The Royal quarters, the dining hall and the library. To either side are offices and guest rooms. The Treasure room is situated so that one must go through the throne room to get it, and trying to tunnel in from any side will  bring you to one of the other rooms first, the dining hall on back, the library on top, the royal quarters on the bottom.  **The Catch: **//Kemalabet Brucheva does not want visitors //

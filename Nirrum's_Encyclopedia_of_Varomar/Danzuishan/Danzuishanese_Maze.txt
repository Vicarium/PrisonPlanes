====== Danzuishanese_Maze ======
Created Monday 18 June 2018

Built in 2672 by Shang Lai, a grumpy white dragonborn, The Danzuishanese Maze is the truest testament to the school of the Irrevocable death.
Manaharamu has not yet been able to replicate this void-netting technique despite centuries of trying.  The maze yet stands as Danzuishan's chief source of exports. The entrance is a massive blue-green copper-adamantide in the shape of a rather bulbous and stylized trout. It sits in the middle of the river in the center of vehi, sitting lower than every single building nearby, its mouth open, exending a platform in the shape of a wide tongue, bifurcated slightly at the tip out into the water. The water never seems to rise up high enough to flood the entrance, which is simply open to a large staircase
Mechanization of the maze-hunting process is impossible, as it has a tendency to change and contain terrifying new creatures
Outside of the Maze there is a sign directing people to go to the Office of the maze hunters to gain information on the plane they've found themselves on

**Shape of brain magic**


The maze is not a puzzle, It is an oddessy. Experienced Maze-runners have been known to get lost for months. Its domed rooms are of hugely varied size, though many feature vaulted pendentives, often as Muqarnas. The ceilings seem to be made of adamantine, but damage done to them never seems to last after the maze shifts.

The colors of the maze tend to be blue green, The lighting is a diffuse white light which *seems* to come from the domed roofs. 

Creatures cannot be banished from the maze, they will always act as if this is their home plane while within the maze

My maze looks like this

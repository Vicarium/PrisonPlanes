====== Myri ======
Created Tuesday 07 May 2019

		Myri hosts the second largest population of lower-middle-class in  Danzuishan. Upriver Fisherfolk who trade further out. Myri's Architecture takes a much more interesting twist as all houses in the neighbourhood are either on the shore or built on solid rock that sits on the riverbed. Bounded on both sides by stark cliffs, the residents of Myri have been forced to build their homes in densely-packed clusters, often stacked on top of eachother. Alleys hide isolated stairways up to the crag-clinging and colorful houses that are built on any perch, held up on stiltsembeded further down the cliff. There is not much room here at all, and it is always noisy.  The houses here are Wood and plaster houses that are highly painted
		

**The Dull Horn Pub. **
	Sitting in the northwest corner of the river and surrounded by skiffdocks, the two-layered and garrisoned pub shines soft golden light all night long. Equipped with its own watermill, the pub stays open constantly. It is owned and operated by an old Maze-hunter named Harlowe.  Harlowe is an intimidatingly built bronze Dragonborn who came from off plane and was delighted to find a home for his people, though not happy about it being under the claw of not one, but three dragons. Harlowe is also a **level 10 Way of Shadows Monk.  **
	
**Endon's bakery**
	One of the most popular bakeries in Danzuishan because of its convenience. An extremely short gold dragonborn man named Lief and his green wife Jasmine. The bread is always fresh because of how fast it sells. The back of the bakery is up against the cliff but a rugged black named barda has made his home, using the warmth of the chimneys for his own small shack. **Lief is a second level Rogue, Jasmine, a second level monk, and Barda, a third level fighter (brute).**
	
**Bach's Tragic Stories**
	A old gnome named Bach sells novellas for a gold, They are all copies of tragedies, but are all predictable, overdone, and rather undeveloped.
	
**Sha Mill**
	A large mill with three waterwheels that sits in the middle of the water. The wheels are guarded by a thick iron cage. Inside, three millstones turn. It costs a copper to mill one sack of grain.

[[Deep Citadel]]

**Cathedral of Io, Chapels of Tiamat and Bahamut**
	Combined, the twin gods represent what the dragonborn view as virtuous. Wealthy, self-sufficient, tempered, and skilled in all interactions. It is presided over by three clerics. A Green, A Silver, And a White dragonborn, all three simply named "Gang" are the clerics there, with White Gang being an astonishing 13th level cleric of the knowledge domain, the other two of War and Light.

**Castle of Shan**
	Decendants, Inheritors, and the families of the Shan stay here. Keemuitsi O'Danzuishan was raised here, but now has her quarters within the Deep citadel itself. It is a low castle near the shore

**Castle of The Birds**
	A tall tower reaching up higher than the other castles. This is the home for the Barigai family
	
**Castle of the Waves**
	A singular small house guards the largest underwater castle in Danzuishan. Home to the Haldar

**Afternoon Parliment**
	A wide-windowed building built to cater to the nobles of Danzuishan as they voice their opinions to the Speaker and Crown. While the Queen maintains absolute rule, she must listen to her nobles or risk being overthrown. Most parlimentary meetings are held here but important ones are held in the Deep citadel.

**Castle of Stone walls**
	Built on the most upriver portion of Gassa, on the inside of the bow is a series of low forts. It is currently the home of the Kyada family, and a staircase that runs alongside it leads up a steep incline to the Police station and temple of Lendys
	
**Castle of the Ancient Tree**
	A single bristlecone pine grows in a large and otherwise sandy garden in this Northside Castle Complex. The Rooftops here are long and flat, allowing guards to patrol along the tops. The inside is exquisitely furnished as this is the home of the Sadamoro.

**Three-towers Castle**
	On the outside of the bow, on the most downriver side, this castle has three tiered-roof towers. The Dave live here, Jacaranda trees line the road nearby

**Castle of mist**
	Built back into the wall of the cliff, the Castle of mist lives up to its name by being perpetually surrounded by a thick vapor, only a few balconies stick out through the vapor to make good use of the Danzuishanese sun. The Terusada live here.

**Mazer's Market**
	A bazaar of nearly a hundred stalls that sell wares taken from the maze. Maze hunters often pawn off junk here without identifying it, and stall owners often sell it at ludicrously high prices in comparison to what they're worth,  a few treasures sneak under the radar, as the shop owners only really have the time to identify the fanciest looking ones to see if they'll fetch a higher price.
	**After 5854, it is revealed that economic influences from Manaharamu have made it difficult to catalog and properly evaluate these items. Both with the Manahararahi influx and the fall of their government, businesses begin to set up looking for volunteers to test these items for curses and to understand their magic. **

Letting the land flood was seen as another bad idea but Din's previous and current grandmothers both said "she hadn't seen him lit up like this since he was a child" and texts from the library support such excitement. Buying almost all of the copper that traders brought in, Din was able to roll miles worth of cord and sell it to manaharamu for a massive sum. The Shop is mostly run by his children, neither of whom plan to take up the Mantle of Din Nayar, so this might be the end of one of the oldest names in danzuishan, and Din is comfortable with that.

====== Gari ======
Created Sunday 19 May 2019

		Gari is the worst part of town. The Lock is well defended and the main channel is kept clear so that merchants can pass through quickly. Furi thugs operate out of this part of town, as does most crime in Danzuishan. 

**Crow and arrow**
	The Crow and arrow is the largest pub in Gari. It is run by a tiefling with a condescending smile named Ukhozati. The Crow and Arrow is frequently where people will end up finding their "criminal contacts".

The Last owner was an Oni Diplomat named Hraelsgrendal, but he was murdered during a massacre in morwerta in early 5851, The Castle is up for sale currently, It has two towers, one set aside for magic, the other fortified for war and a large banquet hall with the interesting inclusion of a raised platform in the middle from which speeches were given. 
	
**Fish Market**
	One of the only reasons to ever come into Gari is to get fish from the market. The denizens of Gari are nearly all fishers or rangers that head out into the wilds of the Gannaga basin

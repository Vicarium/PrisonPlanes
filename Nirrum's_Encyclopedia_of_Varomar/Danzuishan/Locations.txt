* [[+Keina]]  
		Keina is the first town if you approach by sea. It sees a lot of stop-and-go trade from merchants who just want to drop off their goods and head on. It is not a particularly rich district though, as the goods are moved upriver to keep them safe from the consistently invading pirates. Infrastructure here is cheap but tough. Hard stone walls support red wooden pagodas. This is definitely a place to watch your wallet, it might wander off without you. It is also the location of the largest shipyards in Danzuishan.
* [[+Turunga]] 
		Turunga is the second town if you approach by sea. It is leagues more peaceful than Keina and hosts a large portion of Danzuishan's middle-class. Buildings here might reach out into the water, taking advantage of the river itself as real estate. Small aquatic farms are frequent here as supplemental food production. This is also where you'll find a great host of retired sailors, as the weather is quite friendly in this part of the world. 
* [[+Asulaka]] 
		Asulaka is a a refined version of Turunga, The buildings are built in the middle of the water and the river courses through them, powering each house and feeding into solar stills to be collected. People here can even clean their dishes by leaving them in a small alcove in their house where the river runs through so that the fish may eat their leftovers.  Asulaka is a bit of a maze outside of the main channel, but everyone here owns a skiff or a gondola to get around. Much of Danzuishan's industry takes place here.
* [[+Gassa]]   
		The Capital of Danzuishan, in a manner of speaking. Gassa is where the largest lock is, powered by timed  waterwheels and mechanisms, twelve times a day the water raises boats up to the next part of the river, and then lowers others on their way down. Built into this lock and easily accessible from the Asulaka side is their deep citadel. Partially submerged and partially subterranean, This government building connects to the underdark and was the place these dragonborn originally emerged on the surface. The rest of Gassa has the highest property values, as many small castles are built in the middle of a larger lake-like section of the river. Shops line the shores
* [[+Vehi]] 
		Vehi contains the entrance to the Danzuishan Maze. It is also home to the City's temples and the hall of the Danzuishanese Maze-Hunters. These are the people who constantly venture into the maze in the search of treasure and new citizens. Getting three new people out of the maze alive is a great honor and the person is rewarded with an adamantine weapon, sourced from one of the largest adamantine mines on the plane in the same town
[[+Gossogi]] 
		Gossogi is the part of danzuishan where most of the trading is done for the city.  It is near the middle  and is well insulated from extra attacks. Many shops are built up onto the shores and land around. this is Danzuishan's largest neighborhood, despite not having the largest permanent population. Many of the houses are simply rented out to merchants.
[[+Myri]] 
		Myri hosts the second largest population of middle-class in  Danzuishan. Upriver Fisherfolk who trade further out. Myri's Architecture takes a much more interesting twist as all houses in the neighbourhood are either on the shore or built on solid rock that sits on the riverbed. 
[[+Gausui]] 
		Gausui is a mirror of Keina, but also is where one of the river's largest distributaries begins. It is thus important to have a well maintained sliding dam that can redirect more or less of the river in the event of extreme rains to prevent flooding.
[[+Gari]] 
		Gari is the worst part of town. The Lock is well defended and the main channel is kept clear so that merchants can pass through quickly. Furi thugs operate out of this part of town, as does most crime in Danzuishan.

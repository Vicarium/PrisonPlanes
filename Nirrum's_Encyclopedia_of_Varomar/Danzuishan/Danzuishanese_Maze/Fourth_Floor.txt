====== Fourth Floor - Duality and Representation ======
Created Thursday 11 April 2019

The first area of the 4th floor is a crescent that reconnects to both entrances to this floor from above. The crescent looks above a  massive (2 mile wide, one mile high) sandy field lit by what appears to be a painted on moon on the cieling, spreading bright light for 10ft around a  gargantuan and sleek silvery golem with interlocking metal plates and dim light for 20 beyond.  The golem is shaped not unlike a massive slim dragonborn or abishai, with longer arms and 8 eyes.  It sits on an appropriately sized throne made out of a darker material but with similar styling. When the players leave the crescent or make it to the center of the cresecent it stands up, bows and reaches towards the players, palm up, reaching for a sort of handshake. It does not appear to be threatening. It has the stats of an ancient black dragon, but does not have a fly speed unless it gets back to its chair, which attaches to it and becomes its wings. 


There is no way down from the crescent save a 30ft drop

100 ft behind the dragonborn-like colossus, an similarly sized gargantuan Monkey (Rhesus Macaque) awaits (Statted as a Goristro with its strength and dexterity swapped, No gore attack, and climb speed equal to its walk speed, which is now 50ft). It is entirely biological but can cast scorching ray from its eyes at 5th level. Charisma is its ability score for this. It sits in the darkness, back on to the party.

**When the construct leaves its chair, the monkey looks over. When the Construct bows, the Monkey turns quickly, when it reaches out to the players, the monkey charges it, howling. It fights the construct and attempts to throw  it away from the party. **

* Neither the construct nor the monkey are hostile to the players and will //put themselves in danger to protect the party from  any sort of threat.//
	* If the Kraken's door was not the entry and the players open up the Kraken's door and the kraken is still alive, the kraken breaks through the wall and into the area. Whichever combatant is winning rushes the Kraken. If the Kraken attempts to attack the players, both Combatants will attack it with //unrelenting rage. When the kraken is sufficiently dead, both creatures return to threat assessment modes of behaviour, and if the party intervenes, they will become non-hostile to eachother on successful dc18 animal handling checks (made with advantage if the party has food or is able to give food to the construct to give to the monkey) and DC 18 persuasion checks, (made with advantage if the monkey is already somehow calm, or if the construct is offered any amount of money). The monkey does not want the construct near the party, and checks to calm the monkey are made with disadvantage if the party approaches the robot physically.  Five successes before five failures, once a day, can endear the two to eachother, should the party stay with them for that time or find a way out of the maze for them. //**The robot counts as a sentient creature for the purposes of earning the title of Maze hunter.**
* Neither one will attack the players, even if provoked, though they will both attempt to reposition  such that the players are not a threat, moving out of their range if possible
* When one is dead, if the players helped, they will give to the party an item. The construct will give  a Daern's instant fortress, making it on the spot with hundreds of tiny fingers and arms reaching out to pick up its own scrap metal. The monkey sniffs around for a bit and procures a Manual of bodily health, ready to use.
* Both are gargantuan and trapped within the room and think highly of the party unless magically made hostile. The Construct is unable to think in terms simple enough for telepathy to work, while the monkey is a monkey.
* The construct is made of mundane materials, the monkey is made of meat.

At the far end of the field of sand is a single gate That is only large enough for a small character to fit through, and only if squeezing. **The guide says the party needs to turn back and find another way forward, unless a way in is figured out.**

The other side of the small corridor Has Six gates  on the walls of a narrow room with an octagonal pendentive. A square shaft leading from the second floor to the fifth passes through here on the way to floor 5 room 2.
From left to right:
* Door 1 is a gothic iron double gate that is 5 feet across. Through its bars the party can view a room that contains an empty brass braizer, covered in charcoal dust. Bags of charcoal and dried sage, mugwort and lavender, all clearly labelled in infernal. functionally there is over 250g worth of such material here.
* Door two is a sliding glass door, through which the party can see a writing mass of rot grubs consuming a corpse, The corpse has a wand of fireball with 2 charges remaining
* Door 3 is a Stained glass window with a hidden handle that can only be seen on a dc 13 investigation check. It depicts the birth of Bahamut and Tiamat from Io. Behind 
* Between doors 3 and 4 is a spinning **false wall that makes an audible click if door 6 is opened, this leads down to floor 5**
* Door 4 is a rice paper sliding door with stained wooden rods. if the party approaches it, a shadow puppet play begins, depicting the story of Garg and Moonslicer, followed by Ooghie, followed by Los Tiburon, Followed by Phantom the manatee. If opened, the party faces a green abishai. Behind the green abishai is a rack of 6 +1 scimitars, and a bottle of clear liquid that produces very small bubbles if shaken (moonshine).
* Door 5 is a wooden door that is carved to show the line of succession of some human kingdom (sweden, specifically) with each figure shown in its most flattering context.  A wight waits on the other side of the door sitting on a low-level treasure hoard
* Door 6 is a large mirror with an obvious handle. The door swings inward through a small frame. Behind this door is an elf man, who is staring forlornly at a skeleton of another elf, long dead. The elf perks up when the players enter and ask if they're there to save him. If they say yes, he picks  up a large pack and follows. **This creature is an adult oblex**

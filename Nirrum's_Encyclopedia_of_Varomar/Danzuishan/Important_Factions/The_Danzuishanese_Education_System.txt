====== The Danzuishanese Education System ======
Created Monday 29 October 2018

To understand the Danzuishanese military, you must understand that the Dragonborn of this region only just stopped their civil war. To say that every citizen is a soldier is false. To think that they would not kill for their home is also false. The clandestine warfare of the tribes gave rise to their own specialty schools, which eventually blended and separated, combined and refined, and underwent their own independant metamorphoses until they gave root to the Nine schools of Danzuishanese martial arts and life philosophy. Over the past millenia, the specialization of these schools has changed to be more distinct individually. Each of these schools has something to teach about fighting and warfare to anyone who attends them, as well as a skill they specialize in. Unlike the schools of the Manahararahi, or even the apprenticeships of the Lelumadil, the Danzuishanese schools specialize in a style of thinking rather than a specific skill or abstraction. As a result, students of each one of these schools will have vastly different ways of answering problems, even if they have the same solution in the end. Even over their extensive history of internal bloodshed, the Danzuishanese have managed to maintain the idea that the best ideas are born of a chaos, not a void.
	Nirrum's note:// A philosophy that only a few in the university seem to understand. Those Instructors who follow Danzuishanese teachings are those who are able to ensure their message is understood. //
The Danzuishanese military thus, is made not of these schools, divided and thus conquerable, but instead of the natural flow of their organizational ideology. While there is a formal and concrete hierarchy, the approach of this hierarchy to the organization and positioning of their forces is fluid and thus not to be underestimated. The schools are not disparate and indeed, their students frequently move from one to the other to improve an aspect of their training in the one they respect the most.

==== The school of Purity of Thought ====
	This school is built on the idea of formal abstraction. They teach that in practicing anything, you must see what it is //not. //This leads their students to become capitious pedants of many sorts, but by extension it  creates a mastery of lateral thinking and repurposing resources. Frequently the school produces tricky casters, Dazzling warriors, or more frequently, Transfers to Manaharamu. Apt to solve puzzles and **investigations, **The denizens here are always hard to impede. Their Quick-thinking has saved Gausui multiple times.
	
	When faced with an adventuring party, the school of purity of thought will almost always be unpredictable, and will very seldom actually fight. Almost everything this school does has multiple uses or purposes, so at least expect spells like heat metal and prestidigitation to be used it confounding ways


==== The school of Presence of Mind ====
	This school is built on the idea of the acknowledgement of sensory experience and **perception**. They teach their students to see, remember and observe. Aside from archival work, they often tend to focus on knowing what your resources and impediments are. A student of this school is seldom one to forget a name. They often see their students become Tacticians, quick-workers and saboteurs. More than one thief caught by the Brekoli Guard of Manaharmu has been of this school. Samurai, Warlords, Rangers, The sorts that need to pay attention all do well to heed this school's lessons. People often stop here on their way to the maze as they pass through Vehi
	
	When faced with an adventuring party, the school of presence of mind will ensure that their enemies are positioned such that they are in eachother's way or that their resources are minimized.
	

==== The school of the Growing One ====
	This school is built on the idea of the perfection of self. Their students are ruthlessly reminded of their mistakes and criticized harshly in all aspects of form. Through this, experienced instructors teach students to continually improve. The first test of this school it is worth noting is to talk back and defend ones self to an instructor. This school is not for the weak of heart or those who are not bold. Those who eventually leave this school are frequently those who only need **to hit** once, or who cannot be blocked, or whose actions are otherwise extremely decisive in achieving a goal. Those who intend to be archers might have it the easiest here, but Sorcerers and warlocks flourish in this school, their control of their powers often exceeding their wildest dreams. "Was it perfect? Why was it not perfect? What must you practice to fix the imperfection".  The solitary Disconnect of buildings in Asulaka means that many people find a place to be themselves away from prying eyes, thus, the school of the Growing one is stationed here. The building also serves as the **Temple of Sardior**
	
	Oft suited to producing adventurers itself, the school of the growing will ask for their opponent's blessing in battle. They frequently desire only to improve themselves and thus, their goals seldom coincide with the goals of others, but also seldom conflict.


==== The school of Two Hundred Hearts ====
	This school is a bizzare duality unto itself. It posits that the greatest tool that one can wield is another person. Psychology is really the focus of this school some would argue. Students are taught how to interpret power economy, emotional investment, and how to understand the plight of others. The name and idea of thinking of others might label this school as a soft, caring place. It is in fact a school of manipulation, navigation, and achievement. Even Tenkitagan Dal Trussari of Manaharamu studied here. This school produces powerful enchanters, devious politicians, and effective doctors. **Intimidation, Persuasion, Deception, and Insight**. It is only the student who decides how this knowledge is used. The Government in Gassa makes use of their sages. 
	
	When faced with an adventuring party, the school of two hundred hearts will almost never actually be facing the adventuring party. The more of a threat a party is, the more they wish to use them. The school of two hundred hearts when it does have to fight, fights in unison with its own and in discord of the opponent. Two hundred hearts are better than One hundred and Ninety-Nine
		Nirrum's Note: //Disciples of the school of the Growing one would clearly disagree.//


==== The school of Endurance of Spirit ====
	This school focuses almost exclusively on discipline. It has simultaneously the oldest and youngest students. Those put their by their parents to stop being shits and those who recognize their imperfections at older ages. This school makes use of prudence and drive to teach its pupils that they can do more than they expect they can and that they **should ** do more than they think they can. Rather, the school teaches that the limits the mind sets on itself are mostly in the mind itself and not of ones own **constitution**. The limits of reality are still to be respected or one will face dangerous forms of overexertion. They thus produce some of the most damaging evocators and the most patient assassins and spies. They produce the most stalwart of defenders, while also producing those who can go without food the longest. This school is particularly dangerous to fight against and is guaranteed one of the reasons Danzuishan has not only been at war with itself for so long but also why they have never lost a war to an external force since the schools conception. Sieges against these people are historically "a tax on militaries for poor education, rather than any form of victory". They lend well to the Defence of Keina against the Pirates of Grand Tortuga and Kriegcove.

	When faced with an adventuring party, adherents of the school of Endurance of Spirit will always attempt to make it a slog and an uphill battle for their opponents. They do not go down easily.


==== The school of Echoing Immortality ====
	Danzuishanese philosophy concerning their dead is often seen as strange in the eyes of foreigners, namely, they seldom believe in their dead. This is not to say that they lack an understanding of Mortality, that the concept of cessation of function is beyond them, or that they are not able to acknowledge a body on the road as lacking a soul. It is instead that the Danzuishanese do not see much of a difference between an object and its replacement in clerical terms or in terms of legacy. This method of thinking makes their lines of succession remarkably clean. The school of echoing immortality functions much like the library of the college of lore. It is a collection (//The second largest on the plane) // of the **history**, actions and thoughts of individuals. Through the guided study and contextual analysis of these documents, students endeavour to //become// the people they study about or under.  For this reason, the Danzuishanese hero, Corryn of Shan, has over two hundred volumes written of his selfless and tireless adventures despite having died well over three hundred times. A blacksmith in Danzuishan might carry the name of a blacksmith from a hundred years ago, or a bakery might have been signed under the same name for twenty generations. The twist of this school is when the people of Danzuishan truly decide to let something die, it is as simple as not recognizing it, thus it fades into history. Through this method, the most belligerent fighters of the old war were those who were laid to rest the most reverently, the last of them immolated in dragonfire on their funeral pyre only 187 years ago. The instructors of this school have of course, developed many tricks for this custom, and often transitory students will use these tricks to their own ends, **such as learning how to perfectly assume ones identity **or to** read another's thoughts, **or perhaps intuit the steps of one long passed. This sits well with the death-fearing commoners of Turunga
	
	When faced with an adventuring party, someone of the school of echoing immortality might fight them hundreds of times. Different colors, different weapons, same style, same anger, same reason, and in rare cases, the same memories. 


==== The school of Irrevocable Death ====
	A school built, probably by a member of the school of purity of thought, to counter the school of echoing immortality. Attendants of this school are those who challenge those who believe in the way of echoing immortality to follow their deeds. The cross-talk between this school and the school of the growing one is staggering, as members of this one are rarely not also in the other, though the reverse is not always true. There is one key difference between the growing one and the irrevocable death. The irrevocable death students will work towards a single irreplicable goal, frequently of monumental significance or such particular nuance  that none that follow them will be able to truly capture their spirit. The truest culmination of this school is the Danzuishanese maze, which not even the most studious members of the university of manaharamu have been able to begin to unravel the mysteries of. They make great use of the library of Echoing Immortality but also of the trade that comes in through Gossogi in the markets.
	
	If you fight a member of the irrevocable death, you will only ever do so once. Provided they were a good student, you will **remember it forever**.
	

==== The school of Immediate Action ====
	This is the newest, poorest and also most populus of the schools, This school teaches its students to recognize opportunity and recognize weakness. The school by extension teaches efficiency and teaches against overexertion. This school will turn out the most thieves and criminals as the poorest citizens take aim at opportunities without knowing the consequences. It also turns out some of the most efficient soldiers and politicians. It Echoes each of the other schools in what it teaches but also teaches the lowest effort to achieve a goal. Wether that means finding a weakness or exploiting those around you, this school will always produce those who achieve. The followers of the school of Immediate action will  frequently try to sieze immediate **advantages** rather than fighting drawn-out affairs. Furi prodigies also frequently attend this school, as it is the most accessible to them out in Gari. 
	
	If you fight someone who has attended the school of Immediate action, You'll find sand in your eyes, daggers in your back, and your own legs walking you off of a cliff.
	
	

==== The school of the True Void ====
	This school is the smallest, most esoteric and I would argue, the least helpful. The students of this school are aescetics, Monks who meditate in poverty. It has been argued that the true void is simultaneously all other schools while also being none. They believe ostensibly in reducing suffering. Students of this school will be found with the masters of all other schools in efforts to learn wha they need to know to reduce suffering. This is the only results-oriented school of the Nine, but the esotericism of the different-level thinking ends up completing the theme of process-oriented thought. The connection that people make with their own mind, not disimilar from the growing one in many ways, lends itself exceptionally well to warlocks, clerics, and paladins, who need to channel power through them, rather than control it. They tend to also be exceptional at fighting against **Illusion or Enchantment**. They keep their numbers up by being easily accessible to the large populations in Myri.
	
	If faced with an adventuring party, the adherents of the true void usually simply accept their fate or get out of the way.

====== Sons Of The Godking ======
Created Thursday 15 November 2018

The Godking has a humongous number of offspring. This list is a list simply of the sons; this sexist discrepancy is a cultural note that is exclusive to Kholira, owing to their druidic parisitism on the severed roots of Teruna.  Named by their mothers, the children grow up being taught extreme fratrophobia, as one day, in an effort to take the throne from their loving father, even the most demure of their siblings might kill them first. This cements their loyalty in one way, increases their prudence but also, should one be ambitious enough to attempt to take the throne, it prepares them well to know what to study. Thus, the Godkings of old have all ascended, each more powerful and cleverer than the last. A child of the godking who embraces the roots that are placed under their skin at birth often rise to higher ranks, as Moseie himself did. The path to power through the roots is easy, if tiring. Each godking before them is honored, for to honor the kings of the past is to be honored. To erase them is to set the precedent that one is erasable themselves. Each Child of the godking knows this. To further prevent rebellion, Moseie installs many of his sons in Key positions, making a rebellion an uphill battle to replace every brother slain with anyone even half as good at their job. **A very small number** of the Godking's sons //can// enjoy eachother's company. Looking at the few who can, they may very well be among the last to die in their sibling's likely ascension. 

Listed here are the yet (or likely, or seemingly) loyal sons of the godking. Absent are the few defectors as well as the many dead. Many of these sons bear some of the godking's features. Raven black hair, a similar smile when they show one, similar beard growth. The roots that are implanted in their skin always seem to grow in the same pattern, and they all seem to be able to display decent levels of emotion despite the parasitic effect. They also all have a medium to high risk of ear infections and are not affected by certain poisons such as Urushiol (Poison Ivy, Poison Oak) or Psyllocibinoids (sp?) (Psychedellic mushrooms). Most of them do not have the blue skin and orange eyes of their father unless noted, Keeping mostly to the pale complexion and blue eyes of most Kholirahi but most of them are strange, some of them infuriatingly so. Their races are listed for the purposes of stats. They are mostly Culturally Kholirahi. We are not entirely sure how he gets some of these children, as some of the processes involved are extreme to say the least, and some of them we were unaware **could **be the child of a mortal.

		Height: 5'5
		Weight: 169
		Age: 109
	Mallory was a problem child, but the godking saw that coming when he captured a succubus. He was raised to be far far more chill than his heritage would usually permit, in part because of the effects of the roots on his otherwise strong emotions. As he grew, he found his place among the Kholirahi to play deeply to his bent for temptation and hedonism. Mallory is much loved among the Kholirahi, seen as a rather santa-like figure, though his cavorting and boozing seems to benefit him more than others. When he does venture out of Kholira, he often Travels to Ilfea and disguises himself as an angel, though many of the elves there know better. He has His father's hair and beard, but has a **light lavender color for his skin.** He wears a yellow silk Changsan decorated with Purple bears with matching purple trousers.

HIs bow, while quite long, only deals the damage of a shortbow, owing to the fact that it is actually a staff of the woodlands. Gai uses it to  Awaken trees and shrubs around The Ushlubarel riverbasin and to make them loyal to Kholira. He does on occasion do the same to animals. He often travels with a contingent of Other Kholirahi soldiers, some of them transformed into horses, such as the one he rides. The surprise of a horse suddenly reverting to a potent spellcaster is often enough to rout enemies.

His hair is straight to his jaw, his eyes are blue, and his front teeth have a small gap between them. His nets are magical and can be thrown up to 60ft with +1 to hit

Commander **Tamemba (**Druid 10 MOON) ENFP Half-Giant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfNOKQdY-U
		Height: 6'4
		Weight: 200
		Age: 31
Moseie holds this one as proof that the Kholirahi are not sexist, that the roots decide who is worthy and who is not and performed the Ritual for sexual reassignment himself. Tamemba loves to hear his father say this, to acknowledge him as a son, but knows that women are not held equal in his home, and that his father's words are mostly blindness. When Tamemba Transforms, the beasts that he becomes are all sky blue, like his father's skin, Other than that, the most notable similarity is the black hair and beard, both of which have grown long. He can also transform three times between rests. The roots only bestow part of Tamemba's power. He has delved deep into the magic in ways the others haven't, using the roots to listen to the world as the world tree itself does. This has granted him additional insight to build what some would argue are "normal" druid powers


**Ka'zi **(Druid 4, Rogue Assassin 5) ENFP Deva https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLKYstUlyqc
	A wild heart and a charming smile. Uses a **Lance of the angels. **His wings are Tawny with red flecks and his jaw is much more sharply angled than his father's.

	This crimson tiefling has a wild look in his eye, and yet only ever smiles faintly, as if strained to do so. He travels wide, scouting villages for raiding.

**Javovo **(Druid 3, Bard 3 Valor) INFJ Manahararahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYbXV5eMGsM

**Alanwa Alo'ke **(Druid 9) ISFJ Wood Elf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A

**Fierce Infernal Soul Tearer **(Druid 4, Monk 1) (ESTP) Aarakocra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOvsyamoEDg
	This child of the godking revels in murder and has to be kept out of Kholira or there will be a suspicious string of incidents involving small meteors falling on people on cloudy days. He is handsome, that much has to be said. He is only 5'1, but his plumage is a combination black and vibrant pink in smooth lines. His face resembles a southern yellow-billed hornbill in shape, though his bill seems to be made of *gold*. This does seem to be natural, or at least magical.

**Nalabet the whiterooted  **(Druid 9, Wizard 3 transmutation) INTJ Kholirahi
	Nonverbal Autistic. Seemingly Immortal, reappearing near Moseie within 1d10 days of death as though Moseie was some sort of Phylactery. Powerful emotional swings power the roots beyond what people expect of him, yet the roots also keep his frequent anger in check. Frustrated by lack of routine and poor grasp of Metaphor. Occasionally laughs loudly and for long periods of time at things that he finds humourous. Very few other people have ever laughed at the same time because of how different his humour is. The roots under his skin are white like Moseie's and after late 5853 get streaked with red.

**Rugrugoo Sam (**Druid 7, Rogue Thief 3) ISTP Kholirahi

#46 Ex General **Mopagan** (Druid 12, Divine Sorcerer 3) ESTJ Scourge Aasimar  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX4-OMWCdCc
	At 87 years old, Mopagan is nearing the end of his life, a short life for those of Manarahi blood it must be said. He was previously one of the godking's Generals but no amount of greater restoration seems to be able to fix his hip, which occasionally lets out extremely loud popping or cracking sounds, causing him to collapse. In his present state, he tends to the aqueducts and resevoirs in Kholira while in wildshape for most of the day. 
	
**Tavilhar Wavilhar (**Druid 5, Fighter Samurai 5, Rogue Inquisitive 5) ISFJ Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JPDrsXO68A

**Hellslayer The Godblooded **(Druid 10, Fighter 2, Warlock (fiend) bladelock 6) ISFJ Kholirahi **#50  **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIBdpFJyFkc
	Spectacularly vicious in a fight. No issue taking hostages and renegging on bargains to destroy his enemies. Will never be able to live with himself, Immense emotional trauma.
	
**Jazza The Composer (**Druid 3, Bard 12 Glamour) INFP Eladrin  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ddzYpSMMKw
	Casts with a Grand Piano
	
Commander **Lord of the Silt Ravora Dal Kholirahi **(Druid 1, monk Kensei 12  ) ESTJ Bullywug https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/633063
	No one expected this one to survive. Moseie was the only one who believed in his abilities. He guards The rivers near Broadbone and Weighlow from beneath the surface. Extremely serious fighter, though a bit dramatic. 
	
**Tenain, Paragon of the Ground **(Bard valor 7) INTP Manahararahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX4-OMWCdCc
	His body rejected the roots during puberty, then consumed them with no ill effects or scars. He stands little chance of becoming the next godking. But not Zero


**Synmachia (**Druid 2) ISFJ Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0sJvtKrRM
	Not very driven to do anything. Mostly does inventory work, for the Godkings sons are not allowed to be idle.
	
**Cassius (**Warlock Hexblade blade 10) ENTJ Trawe  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXzMD065HEk
	Tore the roots out of his skin, not out of rebellion but out of disgust. Absolute terror, Revels in blood. Weilds a Pike that is caustic to skin, his hands have developed a resistance to this so he occasionally tears off his callouses so he can feel it.

**Mak** **Gumdo (**Druid 5, Fighter Samurai 5) ESFJ Kholirahi https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/14980
	A ship quartermaster with a Lazy eye that some how doesn't take away from his fierce look. Maybe it's the scar over that eye. Maybe it's the perfectly cut beard. Maybe it's the persistent company of a spined devil. Maybe it's makeup. He uses a Guan dao so massive it does 1d12 damage but weighs twice as much as a normal glaive. His captain outranks him operationally only. All of the godkings sons can challenge military orders if they are willing to support the consequence, and Mak is shown to have good judgement tactically, even if he is not so adept at sailing.
	
**Haskil Stillborn (Druid 2) **ESTJ Methuselah (Skin like overcooked pork, Too tight. Big mouth, too many teeth, eyes are covered by cloth) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzWsLaolyLw
	His heart does not beat, He lungs do not swell, His wicked grin stretches ear to ear, and for what no one can tell. He sits atop the castle gate, there he deigns to lie in wait, In starlight clear you'll see his fate, What gives him life is simply hate. Even Moseie does not like this one. This creature, this starspawn, his most wicked son. 
	
**Dettor Bloodstolen	(Divine (druid) soul sorcerer 12) **INTP Methuselah (Seems to be partially made of a living white tree)
	Deviance and theft gave this Bastard's mother the seed of the godking as well as the smallest shred of root. He was born with a cutting of the world tree. His mother's soul was given to a lich after three years of torture by Moseie. One for theft, One for Blasphemy, and one for harming a Son of the Godking before they were grown. He usually stands still atop a house in Kholira. He heals the sick and wounded and tends to small matters within the city, especially if he can do so without moving. He gets his spells from the druid list instead of the cleric list. He also has a constant aura of Calm emotions within 10ft of him. Interestingly, his magic blood comes entirely from his father, as Treysa's magic is a completely different form.
	
**Niel** **Macleodquin** (Druid 6, Monk Sun 6) ESTP Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e53gNqjxhrs
	Very competitive. Despite the name, his family has been in Kholira for almost 1000 years
	
**Jaydi **(Druid 3, Wizard 5, Bard 2) ISFP Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idn50Xj_CiY
	Was born permanently invisible, as if under the effects of greater invisibility. Looks mostly like his father but with a wider jaw and longer, less well-kept beard on top of a slightly longer neck to those who can see invisible creatures.  
	
General **Benton Strongfeather (**Druid 3, Rogue Mastermind 6, Fighter Battlemaster 4) ENTP Aasimar (protector) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep_9S9WH8TI
	Is vocally against the Kholirahi war against other nations but has proved an excellent tactician in that war anyway.
	
**The Experiment (**Minor Deity) INFJ Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9-c2WivvA
	Moseie hates that the child's mother constantly referred to her own baby as "the experiment." Not only is that terribly disconnected but there was nothing experimental about it. Moseie knew exactly what he was doing. The Experiment, or Exi, is what the godking has planned for his people once he has more power. Exi is a quiet god who has no real emotional bonds to Kholira or its people, but gets power from them all the same. He is probably a non-factor in the war. Probably. Often makes flowers grow out of season on unmarked Kholirahi graves all the same. The flowers tend to be, of course, Blue petalled with orange near the center. Interestingly, the tips fluoresce bright green when a sorcerer comes near. 

**Kotsi'a  (**Farmer) ENFP Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP1Meszo0Ys
	A child of one of the very few people Moseie called "wife". Has Downs Syndrome. Originally, Moseie could not bear the thought of raising him, could not imagine what value this child could give in comparison to any of his brothers and would have called for his death. His Mother, A Manahararahi merchant named Gaompetgan chided and mocked the godking for his weakness at not being able to love //all //of his sons, Often publically and loudly. Frustrated but unwilling to kill or harm Gaompetgan else prove her //right, // Moseie let the child live. Kotsi'a has given his father less to worry about than any other son. He is reliable, strong, and hard-working. He wakes at dawn to feed livestock in town, doesn't seem to care when his brothers try to bully him, and often falls asleep underneath his younger brother **Dettor Bloodstolen's** branches. He is 52 years old, mourns deeper than the roots can feed when there is a death of someone he likes, and hugs his father whenever he sees him. Moseie, in a turn of heart, loves this affection, and uses it to unbalance diplomats who do not expect one of the most ruthless people to ever live to show compassion of any kind. Kotsi'a has skin that changes from cyan to royal purple when his heart is really pumping.
		**Nirrum's note:** //Downs Syndrome is pretty rare in snarl, especially in cities. Often a cleric sees to a birth and the buildup of calcium and lack of oxygen that causes the syndrome is rectified immediately with magic. It is possible that Gaompetgan herself was slightly resistant to magic. There are a few families on the plane with this trait. For this to happen to the child of an emperor, a druid no less, is entirely unheard of. Life often throws us strange curves and we do our best with what we have. I do not wish happiness on Moseie, nor would I hold him as an example to follow, but maybe one can learn something from this monster's acceptance.//

**Barstomun Strongbeard (**Druid 6) ISFP Hill Dwarf
	Not actually //The...A..... not the barke... //This is a dwarf who works in a bar and the dwarf's name is Barstomun strongbeard but I swear it's a... well not a coincidence... His mother did this on purpose so people wouldn't attack him. //He's not the Barstomun Strongbeard that you're not supposed to kill. //**Still acts just like the real one though, but it's an act.**// I swear. He bleaches his beard and hair! There's an actual Barstomun in a Xanaran's in Kholira you can go check on to compare! Splash them both with with alcohol and apologize to the one that doesn't have roots under his skin, the real one has only drawn them on himself to blend in. //This Fake Barstomun actually *pays* a portion of his money to the real Barstomun for "Royalties" which the real Barstomun uses to pay his own taxes to the godking (which he insists on doing, depsite not needing to).
	
"**There is a story about a creature that has a name. The story says that a creature can be quiet, not daydream, keep their room tidy and be good at math and that this is typical for some sorts of people. Unrelatedly, some creatures can be made of words and thoughts despite having a physical form. Tangentially related to that, some thoughts or words can make things explode when they are written or thought about in the wrong way. On a completely different topic I know some of the godking's sons are not druids, many of them are bards or other things. The godking, being the topic of another conversation, takes many consorts, most of which are very powerful. Did you know that these consorts have sons? Fascinating! Aren't numbers great? They apply to many things, like caster levels. 2 is a number! That reminds me of the department of pacts and the things they deal with, like vile intelligences from behind the backdrop of the stars and the books they like. Our Archmage is the child of one such creature I think. I think I want to get a bunch of tattoos and cover my skin with glowing green words that are reminiscent of the names of everyone who has ever done something silly. I like connecting sentences like that last one to other ones around it. There are some people that should die. V and A are letters that exist, and sometimes can be put in sequence with other letters like the ones used in the Manar word for 7. I once met a Student with the name Deloch but his last name did not include the number 7, at least, not in manar. Often times, children look like their parents, but different. Some might have a different, more common colour of skin. Pine wood has a nice colour. I once met a girl with green eyes. I have met very few girls with pointed Goatees but there are many other beings who have them"**

	Pretends he is missing one arm, but in fact, was born with an extra stump-arm that protrudes fromt he same shoulder. He keeps his actual right hand tucked up against his stomach when he is away from home, usually holding onto a bottle of sovreign glue.

/--*; **Gavrilo Zumi** (Druid 1 Wizard 9)ENTP Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkRBSZH1EEk
	Gavrilo is a wizard who thinks that he is better than Nirrum the Mad at composing self-referrential spells. He Likes to prove this by leaking information to known spies with such a spell attached to the information about him so that his entry in **Nirrum's Encyclopedia of Varomar **reads "Nirrum is a stupid poo-poo head in a dying civilization that cannot admit its own shames. Manaharamu sucks, Kholira is better. Godhood or bust," Thankfully he is wrong about everything. /;
		**Nirrum's note: **//Now that I read this back, I should probably tell our spymaster.//
	
Lieutenant **Hermani Hatain (**Druid 5, Monk Open hand 6) ISFJ Half-orc 
	A studious and disciplined child, one of the godking's youngest to reach the rank of a proper rudmage
	
**Cintomanithikawei "Cinnamon" Kabulashomontadin (**Druid 5, Sorcerer Draconic (brass)10 ) ENTP Brass Half-dragon 
	A tremendous amount of magic went in to fooling Cinnamon's mother. This Half-dragon has a tendency to hole himself up in the intelligence office and read every single report that comes in on days when his brothers don't chase him out of the room to keep secrecy. Perhaps he'd be better suited in //some sort of place with a library//.
	
**Kolok the stupid (**Druid 1) ESTP Goristro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-DKs0qfdEk
	Another cambion, technically. A failed experiment it seems. Still scary
	
**Keiji Uematsu (**Druid 8, Monk Shadow 6) INFJ Fallen Aasimar 
	Claims to practice the "Dark shadow arts of Ninjutsu," Really just steals their secrets and practices their techniques without their mental training

**Calimane Thyvine** (Druid 5, Barbarian Ancestral 5) ISTP Kholirahi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7KXzKBtgCA
	Calimane has made the dangerous choice of engaging with the spirits of old Kholirahi warriors. Freed of their bonds and with fresh perspectives they are often //very//** angry ** people and unable to control their emotions. This bleeds over to him
	
**Edric the Swift **(Druid 5, Monk Kensei 9) ENFP Air Genasi **#75 **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTidn2dBYbY
	Edric is noteworthy for being capable of walking up walls.  Secretly he is actually just fully capable of hovering and is extremely talented at hiding it. He fights with a longbow and a Blackthorn Shillelagh, both of which he made himself.

**Aput Tehoronianhen **(Druid 4 Shepherd) ESFP Human
	Offplane, unaware of his heritage, The roots have merged entirely with his vascular system and are thus, completely invisble, save one "birthmark" on his thigh where the root was inserted. Decent cook, good Fisherman, Excellent dog tamer. We are certain he would join his father if he knew.
	
**Norman Alexander Perssen (**Druid 1, Barbarian 1) ESFP Human (variant, fell-handed)
	Immense anger issues in the shape of a person. Not even the roots can contain it. Technically the heir to the throne of Konia by nature of being one of the exceptionally few Konians left. Looks very little like his father save for their nose and ears. Allergic to citrus.
	
**Cermhain Alo'a'tab (**Druid 6 Forest, Ranger 3 Beastmaster) ENTJ Siofra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNLbhiJeazA
	Has antlers, hangs out with elk. His body rejected the roots outright at birth. The Cutting they tried to implant began growing a fungus colloquially known as **"Shriekers" **when they came into contact with his blood. 
	
Archmage **Teelo Widebarrel **(Wizard 17 Conjuration) INTJ Kholirahi Lich https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCnJAMkETiU
	Another one of the brothers who has no desire for the throne... because he's a lich. He has been working on a secret project with someone that we can't scry, but it is unlikely to be relevant to the war. Has a very broad chest for his height
			**Update 5854: The person was Pimish barwa, Head of Manaharamu's School of Conjuration. Manaharamu has fallen.**
			
Commander **Jesher** **Bladebearer (**Paladin Ancients 6, Warlock Hexblade bladelock 5, Divine soul sorcerer 3) ENFJ Protector Aasimar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L_iOnLNt9M
	Jesher was cut from his mother's womb by a Konian Conquest Paladin with a vorpal sword who attacked Broadbone when she was there. Jesher was pulled out and not only had the roots  his mother carried already established themselves (a rare occurence, though not entirely unheard of), but the paladin's sword was deflected by the **Jewelled sword hilt** the baby was clutching. The Paladin's Vorpal sword shattered and his soul left his body and settled in the boy's hilt, becoming a greatsword made of some deep blue gemstone. Many of his spells come from the Druid list. Jesher's skin glows softly with many hues, which become more intense if he blushes or is excited.
	
**Unfehrd (**~~Druid 2~~, Bard lore 7) Kholirahi ENTP 
	An accomplished bard who never took well to the druid magic required to master the powers of the roots.
		**Update 5852: **He has ripped out his roots and forsaken his druidic magic entirely
		**Update 5853: Deceased**
		
General **Ambrose the 23rd, (**Druid 12, Artificer Battlesmith 3) Kholirahi INTP
	An excellent tactician. Noteworthy for having near coal-black skin and the same orange eyes as Moseie. Has a staff or fireball rigged to a cube of force with buttons along the grip of the staff allowing him to easily access the cube's functions
	
Warden **Roberto Dreamwarden (**Druid Dreams 14) Kholirahi ENTP
	A strange and eccentric individual who always seems to have trouble adjusting to reality. He is almost always asleep somewhere, frequently in the feywild, but even then, he is still active.
	
Captain **Savatage **(Druid 1, Rogue thief 13) Genasi earth ISTJ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdGD3Ukb3Q0
	One of the Guardians of the prison, a hole in the mountain south of Kholira. Savatage is a quiet and cunning individual who often stares at people questioning him before answering them. He has a stockade of magical items at his disposal, most of them consumable, kept deep in a tunnel in the mountain
	
**Fitzuriel (**Druid 3, Sorcerer wild 6) ESFP Aasimar Protector #85 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Wn1sO720k
	A barely contained vortex of magical energy gathers to fitzuriel at all times. Spells cast within 30ft of him provoke a roll on the wild magic table, rolling twice. Fitzuriel gets to choose which result occurs. Smug. Has Coppery hair
	

**Fleshgubblin (**Druid 3, Ranger Horizon 11) INTJ Methuselah (Looks fairly normal, but every step he takes sounds like a drop of molten glass hitting water)
	Fleshgubblin is perpetually afraid of his //other// parent, who he claims looks a lot like **Haskil Stillborn. **He is barely tethered to the material world and uses this to escape rough situations. He has disadvantage on stealth and perception checks involving hearing while walking but Advantage on all dexterity saving throws and Acrobatics checks.

**Nitros, Blazing Master of Heat, Tamer of the pink fire, One of the Seven Rising Winds (**Wild magic sorcerer 14) ENFP Half-elf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jgrCKhxE1s
	Nitros Blazing etc; is the name given to him by his mother. He does live up to it and if there is a spell that is 7th level or below that does fire damage, he knows it. The roots could not maintain contact with him in his youth so they were removed before puberty, leaving next to no scarring. No one knows what the pink fire is or who the seven rising winds are, but Nitros brushes this off as ignorance.
		**Nirrum's Note: **I could have sworn I had a book that mentioned the pink fire but I can't seem to find it.

Captain **Wara Mira **(Druid 14, monk 2)  ESTP Kholirahi
	Ignores difficult terrain, Movespeed cannot be reduced below 40, save by solid objects like walls and floors, even while swimming, climbing, digging, or in rare instances, magical flight. His legs and hips are indestructible and the concept of of //walking// seems to be magically inseperable. He cannot be chained, he cannot be restrained. Things like sleep, illusions and enchantments still affect him, but if he decides to walk, He cannot be stopped. He is afraid of flying though and avoids it at all opportunities. 
	
	 
Captain **Kenneth Loggins **(druid 8, Artificer 6 battlesmith, Cleric Knowledge 1) INTP High-elf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E
	Oghma values all people who pursue knowledge. Kenneth is one of the only loyal Kholirahi who the god would ever blink toward helping. He is an excellent airship pilot and spends all of his time in his workshop when he is not flying. He seems to be working on a machine of some sort, it's probably some form of airship but from what we can gather, it doesn't have a very large air sac, nor is it made with floating stone
	
**Basar Silter-Yin (**Druid 5) ESFJ Kholirahi
	Works very hard to become a better druid but doesn't advance quickly. Very talkative, Very loyal. Does frontline infantry work to get more experience and to escape the plots of his brothers
	
Lieutenant **Deeping, Prince of War** (Druid 5, Fighter 11 cavalier) ISTP Half-Orc 
	Every generation of orcs from the valley of war has sworn fealty to the Godking. In Exchange the godking makes sure they have a New "prince" when the old one dies. This is a tradition from when it was unlikely for their bid from the throne would have to compete with more heirs than some orc bands have people. Still, the Godking obliges. Deeping is smarter than many of his predecessors and siblings for that matter. He Uses a battle-axe and shield when he is not mounted. He leads the Orc legions into battle on a Grey Render. While mounted, he uses a lance. He worries about the orcs and the Kholirahi, feeling this perpetual cycle of war has no future. Despite this concern, he will have no future without the Orcs and Kholirahi in it. If only he could change them from their wasteful bloodthirst
	
**Muynce Wavilhar (**Druid 2) ENFJ Kholirahi
	A fairly fresh youth, still learning to control his roots.
	
**Raja Wallshatter (**Infant) ??? Gold Dragonborn
	The godking's newest son born in Mid summer of 5851. His mother helps raise him, demanding that he be at least know how to do his own chores. Moseie agrees and has high hopes for this one
	
**Li Shin (**Druid 8) ISFJ Wilden
	Another one of the younger sons. Moseie's first successful attempt at a Wilden son. He is exceptionally quick to learn, and will likely surpass most of his brothers in control of the roots. Hates the cold of the north
	
**Basha (**druid 1, Monk elements 13) ESTJ Air genasi #95 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UanTCFKKg 
	Extremely loud, His voice can carry clear for miles. Uses his voice to activate his disciplines, his favourite being the fist of unbroken air.
		
Captain **Ma, The Reverent Son (**Druid 3, Paladin Redemption 8) ENFP Aasimar Protector https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t1XVSzh8x0
	Armed with a holy Avenger (Liuyuedao, Longsword), and clad in plate armour, this son bears little resemblance to his father in looks. He is in charge of converting the slaves. He believes in what he does, he decries the war and cares for the recruits as if they were his own people. In his eyes, they are. He recieves them from the slave boats. Heals the wounded and beats the captains and crew if there are any major Injuries among the new slaves. The Captains were instructed by Moseie to take it. Once he even punched Moseie in front of the Generals as well as the slaves. For penance, his face was branded with Moseie's own sign. A hand with fingers extended downward holding a star. In his eyes this was a worthy price to pay. Secretly, he is Moseie's favourite pawn //especially// after the punch. **All according to plan.**
	
 **Luwizhi (**Druid 1, Monk sun 3, Artificer Battlesmith 5) INTJ Kholirahi
	Kholira does not have much in the way of public works but this one sees to them. Frequently can be found directing freight and supplies to the workyards, Younger brother to Marjo. Capable of seeing into the ethereal plane and interacting with it.
	
**Marjo **(Druid 1, Monk sun 5, Artificer Artillerist 3) ENTJ Kholirahi
	Does much of what his brother Luwizhi does but is often away dealing with people who attempt to Kidnap the Godking's Daughters for ransom.

**Royal Khan (**Druid 1, Bard Whispers 3 ) ESFJ Solar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gW1uHRPChc
	How Moseie gets sons like these, it is uncertain. The Khan has just turned 9 as of 5851 and is still learning his powers. He appears fully grown and speaks as an adult but sometimes is lacking critical knowledge. He is the spitting image of his father, despite being  nearly twice as tall. His skin is blue and his wings are bright orange, like his father's eyes. His eyes lack Irises or pupils.
	
**Muhu Joko (**druid 8) ISFJ Kholirahi

**Delilah Hungry** (ISTJ) Nightwalker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwtK6R0n0U
	Many of the Godking's daughters get married off for political reasons, sometimes they do so willingly, sometimes what should have been a good story ends terribly. Delilah Suffered horribly at the hand of her husband. In the process she contracted Vampirism. At some point she slipped through a crack in the shadowfell and walked back out as Nightwalker, but with an insatiable hunger for other undead. If you have ever wondered where all the inevitable liches and vampires that come to this plane go, it's people like Delilah that are often their end

====== The_God_King ======
Created Sunday 03 June 2018

The God-King of Kholira, Currently the 14th, Is the title taken by the most powerful druid in Kholira. It is usually hereditary, but there was a coup during the reign of the fourth god king, that lead to the current dynasty. 

The fourteenth and current Godking, named Moseie, is a Half-elf Kholirahi, the other half being so many things. His Skin is deep sky blue, his eyes a vibrant orange. His hair is Black and slightly long, though not to his shoulders. He looks about 26, he is actually just over two hundred. He keeps a short full beard along a very cut jaw (though he frequently changes the style), and stands at a proud 5'11. His ears are short in comparison to many half-elves. He wears black pants embroidered with sliver vines, but other than that, wears nothing else but his crown and Staff. The roots under his skin are white,** And as of 5853** **streaked** **with red**. His crown is made of silver, inset with polished wood spheres. It is small and not particularly ornate. His staff is crimson, with a gold ferrule on the bottom and a transparent globe on top containing what appears to be a small bluish star.

Moseie intends to take over the world, as  the previous nine did before him. He believes his powers are more than god-given, that it is natural law that he is who he is, and there doesn't seem to be much evidence to the contrary. The god-king is born into power from those who have power, then earns power, then takes power. All of his power is a natural consequence to his actions and the actions of those before him. His intent beyond that power is to destroy the will of all creatures below him, to clear their minds so that he may speak and they will only hear his words, not the constant squabble of people who know nothing. Only then, when they hear him, we he lift them into the stars, Everyone a god-king born, and himself, likely far beyond that. He is not a fool, and knows that he cannot yet take on the entire world himself. He is a master networker and tactician, likely only beaten by Orsithach furi in the former, and by none in the latter. His Armies move at his command, and those of his Fatal Generals. These generals are themselves masters of tactics, but mostly of interpreting the god-kings wishes. Two of them are his own sons, one weilding an artifact that got Moseie contacts with the cult of Teruna. To the Moseie, this was the greatest display of loyalty that a father could ever recieve from his son, especially given the nature of the relationship between himself and the thirteen previous god-kings, and was one of the only times the god-king has ever cried.  The more loyal citizens cried as well, for such a move meant stability for their people and was of course rather poetic. 

Moseie spends his time out in the god-king's garden which never seems to have snow build up on it. There, he listens to the cosmos, watching their dance as he slowly works his way to being less insignificant. He enjoys his consorts, and being a father. It can even be said that other than the permanent and imminent threat of fratricide that he gives to each new son, he's a rather good father. He spends his time with his children and knows all their names, the names of their mothers, and takes raising them seriously. He knows one day they might try to replace him, but he has made that transition harder than any god-king before him. He has had to kill eleven of his own ambitious sons and even one of his daughters and a score of his consorts when they attempted to take the throne. He has never felt remorse for those deaths, nor will he, he had to kill eighty nine of his brothers, most of them immortals with over a century of experience. He also feels no remorse for the Atrocities he not only must, but intends to commit in order to gain the power he seeks. He is friendly and fairly approachable despite his goals. He knows not everyone can be as powerful as he is yet, and seeks the value of all opportunities.
Moseie is not particularly forgiving of failure, though he is scrutinous in his punishments or in his delegations, a punishment never exceeds the crime. 
**Nirrum's Note: **//Honestly, the Bards of the college of lore would have become fast friends with this monster if he didn't keep burning other libraries saying they "weren't needed". You can Imagine why the university is still in Manaharamu. What a lunatic. Not to mention his atrocities to his unwilling consorts. //

**As of 5853, The godking has gained the ability to use the Ancient Red Dragon's Breath Weapon once between long rests**

//The god king is no stranger to combat, especially not from powerful enemies, he takes a bit of joy from a good challenge. He uses his rudmagic wantonly, and relishes the chance to talk with his opponent and put them to his use. His staff of stars literally channels the power of a star and is volatile. He uses it to cast but mostly so he can look good while casting, the roots under his skin are really all he needs. He is Directly attuned to the living magic of The Great White World Tree Treysa. //

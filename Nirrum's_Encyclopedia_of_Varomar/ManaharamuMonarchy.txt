===== Description =====
The city-state and nation of Manaharamu is one of the grandest sights on the plane. Sitting on the east corner of the Kavir-e Namak Desert against the Mohara mountains, The city of Manaharamu has three parts. The Powerplant, The City, And The University.  It was Founded by the Mana People, one of the oldest civilizations on the plane, and its name is a triple compound meaning roughly "Magic Mountain City" or more literally "Energy Hill Place"

**After 1  early spring 5854, Manaharamu is a ghost town. A good third of its citizens are captured or dead by the hands of the Kholirahi. The Queen is in hiding, The university remains a field of shambling undead who seem to be doing some menial work. The only places untouched are the Monastery which still generates power, The druid circles that were inside the University, and the parts that mages took with them, like the Tower of The school of Transmutation. The Manahararahi Diaspora begins and its people move to find a new home for their culture. **

**The Main remaining residents other than the druids are Kotsi Kemadumana'ab, Garhun ten-cages, and the Ghost of Moin Matur, the previous archmage. They seem to be hatching a plot.**

==== Urban: ====
The city of Manaharamu is made of buildings covered in Plaster, some of them built on wooden frames, newer ones made with steel. They often are only two floors high and rather small. Family groups are intimate, often sleeping the same room. Tradition in Manaharamu will often give the second floor to their children if they are studying at the university. Most houses have a balcony built into the second floor and have large windows. Houses are often Separated by small alleys, and many streets are backed by small parks, most of which lack vegetation but may contain playgrounds for children. Extremely few houses will have a private garden or plot of land adjacent. None have a lawn. All of the houses in Manaharamu have power and Sewage, along with Refrigeration and Electric ranges. The streets of Manaharamu tend to be straight, cobbled with flagstones, and are often brightly decorated by the people who live nearby. The City extends around the Grand Royal Palace of Manaharamu, a great fort made of pale stone, mostly marble, though it is surprisingly tough. The palace has four main outer walls, each joined together by a square stone tower made of highly constrasting black marble. The palace is placed at the beginning of Mohara's southwestern slope, and is visible from the entire city. The southeast of the city houses the University of Manaharamu, the largest learning institution on the plane, outstripping the others by far. In a rather large snowball effect, it has become known simply as //The// University. Behind both the palace and the University toward the summit of Mohara, is the Power plant, which contains a little known monastery, Housing the Manarahi Ascetics. Manaharamu draws its power from Four Gigantic Teslaharmonic Crystals. Technically They're Thaumatic Teslaharmonic Toroids but no one cares about that. The crystals draw energy from the massive magical differential between the nearby planes and the cold emptiness of the far realm. They are heralded as one of the most stable magical items ever created, and are incredibly mathematically advanced, overshadowing the rest of Manaharamu's other impressive technological feats by leaps and bounds. Around the city are 17 Airship ports, each with greatly varying sizes of airship. They are mostly for military use and complex to learn and operate. 

Common Buildings are approximately 30x30, with small kitchens, Multipurpose livng rooms furnished with plush cushions, and Water Closets, which are almost always under the stairs.
Larger Houses Tend to Include 50x20 Indoor Pool enclosures,  10x10 kitchens, Individual bedrooms and Guest rooms, and an office on top of the original design. 

Temples tend to be small ampitheatres, save the ones that double as workshops, such as those of Moradin. The gods of the knowledge domain have shrines in the University Orrery. 

Shops are frequently hole-in-the-wall deals if they are not Market stalls in one of the Three Baazars. They are small and often cannot hold more than six customers at a time. Competition is fierce.

Sewage and wastewater are collected by the university, processed, and used in the University's Botanical Gardens and Arboratoreum as fertilizer.

Water is sourced from Enchanted fountains which run seemingly endlessly around town as well as some mountain springs. The City runs massive trade profits but can be partially sufficient on herbs and rough plants that grow on Mohara. Because of its harsh environment, fortified position, Airships, and **sizable force of high-level casters,** attacking Manaharamu is seen as a universally bad idea.

==== Environment: ====
Manaharamu and the Kavir-e Namak desert sit south of the aegis mountains and thus recieve little rain from the south (and west)-blowing predominant winds. Manaharamu is ill-equipped to handle rain, and the occasional squall from the south is often quite a destructive event, flooding many houses and sweeping many belongings into the street. The Preciptation never lasts long. 

The Area is of course, Extremely hot, Heavy armor, quilted clothing, or anything not enchanted to be perpetually at a comfortable temperature is ill advised. Locals wear long flowing cotton thobes, and occasionally silk. The daytime actually contains very little activity, and most people are active during the morning, late evening, or night. Nights remain warm at 15 degrees (c), comfortable for a light jacket. 

The Area occasionally gets sudden sandstorms, which heavily obscure everything and generally make people feel uncomfortable. In a Sandstorm, visibility drops to 10 feet, with disadvantage to see up to ten feet further. Ranged attacks have disadvantage past 10 feet as well, and are ineffective beyond 25. Checks made to hear during a sandstorm are at disadvantage, and verbal conversation is impossible past 40 feet, even when yelling. Sandstorms last for 1d6 hours and arrive suddenly, moving at a speed of 45ft per six second round.  



== Ecology ==
The harsh terrain hides a great variety of creatures that have learned to survive and adapt in the desert which might see rain once a year in the "summer" when the sun passes to the south and heats the endless Ocean. While parts of the desert are hotter than others and give up water more easily, others are much more hospitable to life. The area around The Mohara is particularly fertile but not quite enough for large scale agriculture. Mohara's small foothill region host walnuts,sidra, acacias, and date palms, which the locals harvest for various things, including their own local dishes.

==== Economy Notes: ====

== Supply chain: ==
	* Most food goods come in through trade through the west and East Gate. Citzens highly prize fresh fruits and spices. This sort of trade drives the economy of far flung towns such as Mokoi Tha'am and Sha'at guun
	* Messages are sent by small magical constructs known as  Pial. The Pial are shaped like tiny flowers made out of blue glass. They have straight stems and telepathy 1ft that allows them to recieve and convey messages as well as identify the recipient. They only activate once 5 copper pieces or more has been placed in a small coin tray which tilts to store the coins in a small box underground, where it is collected by a small train-like construct once a day at midnight.
	* Most exports in Manaharamu are from the University which sells spell scrolls and enchanted items to locals without tax and to foreigners with a 10% sales tax. You must live in Manaharamu for five years to be considered a citizen for these purposes.
	* Much of the trade goes into supplies for the university, and caravans will take out large contracts on guards
	* The Crown takes a proportionate percentage of all earnings in the city in order to maintain the high level of social services available.(7.5%)
	* Many foreigners come to Manaharamu in order to get access to Magic services that may not be available elsewhere in the world. Reconstructive Transmutation via Greater Polymorph is a common choice, as are Greater and Lesser Restoration, as well as regeneration. 

==== Sociological Notes: ====
	* Many of the Manahararahi are descent of the Manarahi, And many of them still speak in Manar, The ancient language of the Mana people. Despite the common use, Manar is a dying language and is being superceded by Common rapidly
	* The largest sources of entertainment in Manaharamu are University public exams, performances, and small boardgames such as Go and Reversi. Gambling is not common in Manaharamu and it is seen as extremely-low-class, and a gateway to delinquency.
	* Manaharamu has a public health system but it comes at the price of experimentation. Due to the nature of magic and the poorly scaling rules of chemistry, Experimentation on sapients isn't entirely risk free, and meds that pass all other forms of ethics screening may end up causing severe damage when a host has specific instabilities. More than once has a person gone in with a broken arm and come out as a rampaging monster. Usually though, one can expect simple and either free or inexpensive treatment for most ailments. 
	* Police are frequently magically trained, though only rarely magically equipped. Most police are proficient in Dispel magic, Remove Curse, and Counterspell. 
	* The people are generally distrustful of outsiders and keep their coin close when foreigners are around, guards might be unjustly called on foreigners just because someone feels unsafe. The Police deal with the often are are usually calm in asking foreigners to move to a different part of town
	* The overwhelming presence of mages in the city makes it nigh indestructible, people are relatively carefree when it comes to warfare as they frequently believe that it is impossible for them to be invaded
	* Magic is seen as aspirational and magical and government jobs are much sought-after by the common folk. Only a few types of non-magical duties are deeply respected, the most fabled among which are the Trussari, Entirely nonmagical warriors who are called upon to take on threats that resist magic or are otherwise resistant to the might of some ten thousand casters of the first level or higher with almost one hundred who are of the fifteenth level or higher. Members of the Trussari are court-honored fighters and are gifted with Adamantine weapons, similar in composition to those of Danzuishanese maze hunters. They are given access to wide varieties of weaponry and armament. To be a member of the Trussari, one must be of at least sixth level and must be capable of defeating a univeristy-created construct while it projects an antimagic field.
	* Because of the healthcare and hygene situations, Mortality rates are low, and thus, the life expectancy of humans (for example) is around 80 years. 
	* The most dominant race in manaharamu is half-elf, making up approximately 20% of the populace, Because their needs are a mix of human and elf needs, the 15% human and 13% elf populations are relatively well looked after. The most disenfranchised members of society are ones that require magic to sustain their bodies, as they are affected by the extremely heavy thaumatic field around the town, as well as the extreme lack of Mana on the outskirts of town. Such Creatures would make consitution saves to avoid exhaustion if travelling

** THE SUNSTORM CROWN**
A medium crown that seems to be made of gold, set in untarnishable copper. It consists of a Band of Copper and gold around a soft leather buff.  From the front and back of the crown protrude 8 peaks, the three front most ones being the tallest. The Central peak contains three small Bright orange gems that seem to glow in any light. The marquise-cut Garnet Spessatines are arranged such that their peaks are arranged in a ray, 30 degrees apart from eachother, the central one pointing up and the other two expertly set so their points orient toward the other two peaks on the crown. The other two peaks are curved, fang-shapes inlayed with  labradorite in small and thin versions of the same shape. The band is set with tungsten studs. The crown seems to be indestructible and will always feel comfortable on the head of a medium-sized creature. The nature of its magic seems to suggest paranoia, or maybe just concern.

===== The Tunnels =====

Taking the tunnels downward is mostly a slog, old and long since emptied rooms that once served as intermediary barracks have become filled with gricks, piercers, Ropers. Thankfully, the pathway forward is cleared for quite a long ways down. 


**The path**
	Long and hard looks at the path indicate that it is palgioclases. the Rock around here is mostly white-yellow in color with sudden speckled shifts into Granite and Mica. Streaks of lime and occasionally quartz veins dash through the stone.

**Win condition**
	Make it through the Black door 

**Treasure:**
	2400 cp, Hidden in a box on a ledge 2 x Blue quartz (10 gp) in the wall 
	
**Catches:**
	The Citizens do not trust the party. 
	Damien keeps disappearing at the first sign of trouble, usually is found protecting children

**Twists:**
	One Kholirahi Elite follows them into the tunnels, Enjoys the chase
	
	Dangling from the celing is a thick rope. Touching the rope with anything causes that thing to be hauled up into the cieling where one will find a Cave Fisher resting on a small ledge
	
**Enemies**
 8 Giant crabs in a river
9 stirges
1 Hobgoblin skeleton wielding a Hobgoblin Kastane (1d8 slashing) And a lance (1d12) and Riding a Zombie Warg

==== The Catacombs ====

 through the black door One will find a concave citadel  in a Semi circle. All around are dwarf and Hobgoblin-made weapons and armor. Most of them rusted to pieces, some of them partially intact. the floor has a layer of water, up to 6 inches deep in it. The wall of the citadel is covered in arches, which appear to contain hobgoblin corpses.

The Party can find any martial weapon here, either of dwarf or hobgoblin make. This place is eerie and quiet.

**The path**
	Set in Granite, a large 4-pointed fortress with concave sides. It can be either walked around or explored. Within, a series of short hallways leads to a throne room, a kitchen, and a barracks. 

**Win condition**
	Get to the tunnel on the other side of the Fortress
**Treasure **
1100 sp of goblin mint, 50 gp of Dwarven Mint, Potion of Healing (common, dmg 187), on bodies around fortress

==== The tunnel to Skalmirthon ====

 Nearly immediately upon entering  The tunnel, there is a massive rumble which stops briefly before the party is **blinded, as the tunnel behind them lights up, the citadel behind them crumbles into the newly formed blackwater crater, boulders crash down the hill, unsupported by ancient stone. It is a lovely sunny day. A loud BANG deafens everyone until they can get any magical healing. People begin screaming, though no one can hear them. Two Kholirahi ships fall into the crater and the airships withdraw rapidly. It is a crater about half a mile deep and seems to  have had the epicenter of the event just below surface level. Two airships break off, one headed south, the other headed east.**


**The path**
The tunnel turns quickly into a branch mine on the other side of the fortress but the pathway of the dwarves through it is obvious. 

At one point a week in, the pathway stops above a 384 foot drop into a cold and shallow river. The pathway on the other side is largely covered with a large pile of loose gravel. Landing on the gravel requires an acrobatics check with a DC of 10 to not fall backwards into the ravine. For an added problem, the cieling is covered in 20 darkmantles who attack if there are sudden movements.
	* the river contains fish which can be collected with rod or net with a DC 11 check, advantage if any bait at all is used. there are 1d60 fish in the river and they replenish after a week
	* The wall of the crevice contains a large slab of Labradorite, which if mined is worth 100 gold/lb
	* Darkmantles are edible if eaten (5lb)
	* if they **descend into the chasm, the temperature seems to drop a solid 10c**

The hallway continues for another week, rising slowly in temperature, the air gets progressively warmer at one point there is a wooden shack with nothing inside save a couple of stools. The wood of the shack is covered in lichen

 Wickerly
	A small town near the end of the Ushlubarel River. The inhabitants are short humans and halflings who Tame Giant owls as pets and on occasion, mounts. The people take great pleasure in their River which hosts a great many fish that seek the warmth from the river, which is fed by volcanic vents in the nearby hills. The Wickerly residents wear cloaks made of a northern relative of Elephant Grass and Owl Feathers, Their houses bear much the same design. The town has a small Power plant that runs off of the difference in temperature between the wamrth of the river and another smaller aquifer, as well as a waterwheel and Turbine. It simply powers town lights at night, houses don't tend to have their own. The Residents are largely idylic and this makes them prey to things that lurk in the night. The owls Tend to protect them from most of their threats. It is nigh impossible to capture a wild owl for a mount, but possible to get one of the tame ones. It takes a lifetime of bonding to acheive the grace to mount one. Hunting with them, well that's easy.

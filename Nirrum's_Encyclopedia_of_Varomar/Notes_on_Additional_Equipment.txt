==== Barber's tools ====
	An adventurer with poor hygiene is just a filthy Taparmishi. An adventurer with good hygiene is an inconvenienced tradesperson. A Barber does more than just cut hair and beards, they also groomers in general, known for cleaning teeth and for a while they were responsible for surgeries. Sometimes, you've got to look better than like you just wandered out of a crypt after wandering through the mud and rain 
		**Components. **Barber's tools consist of a few sizes of scissors, a straight razor, an alum styptic block(also a deodorant), a hair brush, a stiff tooth brush, a comb, a nail file, a lather brush, shaving cream, a mirror, strop, whetstone, tweezers, a bottle of oil, a bottle of salt, soap, a towel, and face cloths of course. Some kits include makeup
		
		**History. **You've learned some historical traditions, and for this, you can often identify depictions or people's time period from their looks alone.

		**Medicine. **Diseases of the skin and mouth are well within your domain to diagnose and possibly treat. Hell, you can even do basic oral surgery and stop small cuts from bleeding. Too bad the kit doesn't include anesthetic

		**Performance. **Your ability to get into character is aided by your ability to make yourself look as you please. 
		
		**Persuasion. **Looking good helps you quite a bit when trying to get your way.
		
		**Groom. **You'll probably have to do it for the whole party. As part of a short rest you can work on up to three creatures to make them look their best for a few hours. As part of a long rest you can get them ready for the whole day. The haircut will last a few weeks at least.

====== How_it_went_for_me ======
Created Wednesday 31 October 2018

The midgard party has been my testing ground for this.
They have entered the Antechamber and hall of concept. At one point they //carved out the head of the world spirit mural. //Nothing happened but the tension at the table was high
They've found the body and the tools and one player carved the World-spirit into part of the unfinished wall, modestly well. Again, nothing happened
The real champion was when Vaylen, the warlock, used a spell to help read the poem on the door. One person tried to remove the gold but didn't think to make the arcana check first

==== The Smithy ====
	The local smithy is run by a wiry and thin half-elf named  Tongan Savenshatenka(ISTP). He is covered in Tatoos that sit on muscle that seems to stretch too far to make it to his bones, depicting what he claims is the three-eyed dragon that saved him as a child. It looks more like a slug. Tongan hits the steel on his anvil with strength that seems beyond his thin frame, pushing the metal with every strike as if it was far closer to unfired clay than should be possible. For his talent, he is payed little, but enough. He is a capable smith and can hammer out an axe in an hour or a sword blade in a day
		//Tongan is secretly a Fifth Pact of the Blade Warlock who serves an Aboleth by occasionally sending adventurers into the ruins of Graoton.//

==== Kevin ====
	Kevin (ITSJ) is a dry and quiet Blue Dragonborn. He's also a pirate with an eye for small business. He tends to take things like cutlery and housewares and sells them off here in Kriegcove. He also stocks some strange wares, odd books, old maps, and pawned off jewelry. He's often on his ship, which is notably the only one with a ballista.


==== Old Mood ====
	Old Mood(INFJ) is the oddest member of the community, He spends a lot of his time either hip in the ocean or wandering through the woods near town. If one finds him, you might be able to get some magic goods off of him, as he makes wands and staves in his spare time.
	
==== Gargol Gulhanger ====
	A hill giantess(ENFP) that runs the largest group of beligerents in town. She is the best person to get most supplies off of because she hoards much of what her people steal. Her prices are exorbitant however, and she is just as likely to steal the things you buy from her back.

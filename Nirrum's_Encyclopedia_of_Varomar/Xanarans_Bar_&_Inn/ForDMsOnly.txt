**It is almost certain, if you have found this page, that you are not who it was intended for. I ask, politely, that you keep this knowledge a secret for the health of the game. I have no expectations that you follow this advice, and nothing bad will happen if you don't, save that your game may feel more hollow, your friends might dislike you, your DM's plans may be ruined etc; **

**I know you just want to know, but keep it a secret if you can OK?**

And if you're going to spread it make sure it's //after// something relevant has happened

**Thank you**

The rules surrounding Barstomun and Xanaran's are crafted to be // as bullshit as possible.//** There is an in-lore explanation for this.** This explanation changes for most planes but it generally works like this. The concept of a Xanaran's bar and inn is an extremely powerful eldritch being. Not the dwarf, not the physical location, but the //idea. //The creature that is the essence of barstomun strongbeard is an extremely powerful being that is fairly young as such creatures go, time dilation and planar shenanigans notwithstanding. The creature is //Entirely// obsessed with Xanaran's Bar and Inn. It cannot be communicated with, It cannot be reasoned with, it cannot be interfered with. It is patient but becomes extremely hostile to things that interfere with Xanaran's Bar and Inn. It does not seek to convert all buildings to a Xanarans, it just wishes for there to be a Xanaran's available, should the need arise, and its ideal future simply contains a visit to a Xanran's bar and inn. Because of this laser focus, even other eldrtich entities try to avoid incurring its ire. In its mind, planar destruction still only counts as one interference and can usually be ignored. Barstomun strongbeard, the original, was just an innocent bystander who happened to be caught int his entity's obsession. The Original Xanaran is likely unaware of this phenomenon (possibly due to death from old age), but should he (A level 15 red dragonborn fighter with expertise in acrobatics) enter a Xanaran's bar and Inn, he is given due respect as the proprietor. 

Xanaran is magically compelled to not ask questions about the bar and inn, though he is, as its proprietor, allowed to change things as a business owner would. If a question is asked that Barstomun nor Xanaran can answer, "The boss" and "Maggie" are brought up again, and Xanaran nods knowingly.

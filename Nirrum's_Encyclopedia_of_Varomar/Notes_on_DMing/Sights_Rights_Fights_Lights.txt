===== Sights: =====

Sights are simply things that are out of the ordinary and may be of interest to players. A simple example may be an unusually tall tree, or a more complex example may be a series of standing stones with runes carved into each. “Sights” serve a few purposes, firstly, they add depth to your world, they show it’s not just miles of boring plains (you do want some boring plains, but how to deal with them we’ll come to soon). Secondly, “Sights” are excellent ways to get players invested and are ripe for player interaction. Maybe they decide to climb that tree or decipher those runes. What this all leads to you can still control, while the runes for example may serve as a distraction, they could still interesting information for the dungeon they’re travelling to. “Sights” not only add depth to your world, but history, and are useful for creating memorable moments and landmarks.

===== Rights: =====

Admittedly this one is a stretch on the word “Rights”, but here it refers to property rights, or more accurately, areas controlled by an organisation. This could be something such as a military base, or a thief’s hideout. Whether or not the organisation is hostile to your players or allows them to pass freely is up to you, but “Rights” also have a few other uses. They give the players an initial impression of an organisation. There’s no easier way to show players someone is powerful than them having their own mega fortress. They also give the players a set location where they could interact with this organisation. If they need to hire some thieves later on, they know where a hideout is now, so they could easily return. “Rights” help anchor and set up the larger groups of your world, they can help build an atmosphere, and add believability.

===== Fights: =====

“Fights” are exactly what you think they are, regions where fights happen! A warband of orcs, a pack of wolves, even a patrolling dragon. Fights on the surface are pretty simple, and if used improperly just feel like a random encounter from an old final fantasy game (nothing wrong with old final fantasy games, but we can do a little better). “Fights” can be used in a few different ways. Firstly, they can allude to an upcoming area. That warband of orcs may be from a nearby ruin that’s been taken over by orcs, so the party now has some intel, and experience with the tactics the orcs use. This helps with making the world feel more alive, entities aren’t just staying in their regions, they’re actively moving about, interacting with the world themselves. “Fights” are also fantastic at developing a sense of how dangerous a region is. The woods filled with “Fights” hexes can make players understand quickly that sticking to the nearby plains for travel is safer (or it could entice them further to your hidden forest dungeon!). “Fights” can also be used if you’re finding a more mundane region difficult to fill with features, those boring plains could have some wolf packs to spice them up a little. “Fights” can also refer to an environmental challenge, such as crossing a fast-flowing river, or traversing an icy peak. Overall, use “Fights” hexes to give players a better understanding of a regions perils, while also sneaking in some world building.

===== Lights: =====

Last, but certainly not least, are “Lights”. “Lights” here refers to the lighter hearted, peaceful hexes. These can feature things such as travelling merchants, a small logging cabin, or simply animals grazing in fields. “Lights” are usually found nearer to civilised areas, but players who’ve gone through hell and back love to find them out in the wilderness. “Lights” add plenty of roleplaying opportunities, but also help with world building and setting a tone. “Lights” can be used to add a bit more detail to more boring, civilised areas, they can also give a sense of realism to a kingdom/empire (plenty of my “Lights” are simply farms or logging camps).

==== Mix and Match! ====

These hexes don’t necessarily need to be exclusive, you can mix and match most of them quite easily (except Lights and Fights). Those standing stones from your “Sights” hex could be the home of a druidic circle, or they could have undead guarding them. That small logging cabin from your “Lights” hex could be near that unusually tall tree.

==== In Conclusion ====

Obviously not every hex should be something incredibly exciting, but something simple as “You travel through this region with ease, the only thing of note is a few large puddles with rocks sticking out of their centres” adds a little bit of interest. Sure, while real life has miles upon miles of empty wilderness, that doesn’t mean we can’t make our DnD wilderness that little bit more interesting. Also, if you’re stalling for time because your players are way off track and have ruined your best laid plans, throw in a mildly interesting “Sights” hex and they may spend the rest of your campaign insisting they thoroughly check out whatever’s there for loot.

Lastly, and possibly the most important thing, you don’t need to know the significance of everything you put in. That massive footprint in the middle of the plains without any explanation? Put it in because it sounds cool. Chances are your players, as they’re often to do, will end up rationalising their own explanation. Simply build off that, maybe they were so clever they got your exact plan right, or perhaps they were only slightly off. If you let your players get things like this right sometimes, then not only are they worldbuilding for you, but they’re feeling like they’re accomplishing something as they unravel the secrets of your world (just be careful letting them know you don’t know the secrets either, don’t want the curtain of the great DM of Oz being pulled aside!). So, by breaking down your hexes or map regions into what purposes they serve, and what category they mainly fit here, you can develop your world quickly, in a way that focuses on player interaction.


	* I think I'd distill this down to two rules...
			There should be something interesting in every hex.
			Something doesn't have to be useful to be interesting.
			Honestly, the second rules feels like a clarification or aside, but I think it's an important call out. Those were the two major points I pulled from your post, anyway. The first point is kind of obvious in retrospect, but the second point is equally important. I think if one were just suggested to put "something interesting" in every hex, they'd feel the need to make sure that something had some important game reason for existing. The idea that there should be things which are interesting but aren't (intentionally) meaningful is... non-obvious to me, at least, and almost revelatory.

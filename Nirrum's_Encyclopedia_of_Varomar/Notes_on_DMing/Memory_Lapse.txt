Prison plane of dreams

Actors: 
The party- Memories lost, uncertain of who or what they are.
It is five Hours to sunset
You are all in a dark room. Door locked, bars.

 guard looks at the party, confused, "I think you're supposed to stay in there"
Guard rings a bell

Other guards attack. 

In a mine, hurricane lanterns on the side.

Fight bandit captain, get clear octagonal crystal

Leave cave to find a tower in the distance, Energy tearing away from it, constant storm in that direction

In between is a maze-like town with undead
a dragon

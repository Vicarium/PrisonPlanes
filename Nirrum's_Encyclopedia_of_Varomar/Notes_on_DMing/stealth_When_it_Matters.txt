====== stealth_When_it_Matters ======
Created Tuesday 16 October 2018

We've all been there. A player tells you they want to sneak through the woods to look for signs of trouble. You say, "Okay, roll stealth." They roll a 3. "Well," they say, coughing suddenly, "I mean, uh, I let Bob go first, of course." Immersion deflates.

But what about this instead?

They want to sneak through the woods to look for signs of trouble. You say, "Okay, you do so." They tell you where they are going, and you tell them that they come across a clearing. They look around the clearing for a while when you suddenly say, "Hey! Roll stealth!" They don't know why they need to roll, but clearly, something is up. They roll a 16. You say, "Okay, you're fine." They stop what they're doing, suddenly realizing they are alone, in a dangerous wood, and perhaps they are in over their head. Dramatic tension increases.

Calling for Stealth Rolls only when it Matters

The idea is simple: don't call for stealth rolls until it matters. This is a great way to answer the age-old question, "Do the characters know how stealthy they actually are?" One method of dealing with this has always been that the DM rolls stealth for the characters in secret. But, in 5e, what about characters that can attempt rerolls, such as having the Lucky feat? This is a way to deal with that scenario without taking the dice out of the players' hands, so they can still get to revel in the triumph of rolling a natural 20 or wallow in despair at a natural 1.

Good Day and hello there! I am Nirrum, and on average, the author of this volume, //Nirrum's encyclopedia of Varomar//. I've been channelling some mysterious force -which honestly just seems to be an alternate version of myself- in order to bring you this book! It has come to my attention that even some of the highest ranks of archmage in many other planes don't know of our home! Snarl is the name of this broken prison plane. It is one of many in this region of the far realm, all and each designed to act as the cell for a single eldritch entity. These entities vary greatly in nature and form, but they each have a similar theme. One aspect of the universe would be targeted and consumed without regard for consequence or order. In our particular plane, that aspect is death. Teruna, the consumer of death's long arm, has been locked away under our plane, allowing the natural order to continue, as well as the concept of healing magic to exist. I have seen experiments done with the demon's energy and let me be clear **it is not a good thing to be immortal in the way it would deliver it.** There are other such creatures, too. One which hates life, one which resets time and consumes the difference, and another that just eats and freezes time entirely. There's one that eats magic, and one of our sister worlds, Earth, has unfortunately fallen to its terrifying maw. Not many have heard of that place. I hear from those who used to live there that there are less dragons there, but more mysteries. One of them eats dreams, thus consuming memory. Another has been revealed recently to wish to "become perfect" by consuming "perfection". Thankfully we live on the least crazy carnival grounds, Don't you think? I suspect you'd like to know more about us.

There are forces on the plane, each conspiring to topple what order we have. From the God-king of Kholira who seeks to enslave us all (//and burn my library, which I will not allow)//, to the cult of changelings that seeks to unleash Teruna, to the Criminals that are the Furi, to the assorted fiends that get banished here on a dialy basis. But outside of them, the plane is relatively peaceful! Kind of! The Cities here are large and thriving because they lay in the safer areas. The problem with prison planes is that they often act as a sort of net for things cast adrift among the planes. Infrequently, about one in 640 000, creatures hit with the banish spell, or banishing smite, or any sort of deplanarization process will end up breaking through the spell's tenuous hold, and become hurtled through the planes, usually landing in the feywild or shadowfell or being picked up by some interplanar traffic. One in one hundred and sixty thousand of those end up on one of the prison planes. I do not fully understand the mathematics behind it, but our plane is uniquely shaped, such that you can be anyone from anywhere at any time. People have met their heroes separated by centuries, their ancestors, their descendants, their gods. I am told there is an equillibrium where you cannot meet yourself (Here at least) and that there are all sorts of time angles and trajectories involved in it. The Second law of thermodynamics is certainly involved. That Bastard. People leaving the plane may pop out in their own past, in the future, or in rare instances, simply die in the process, or even end up somewhere else entirely.

Unfortunately this means that the things that end up in this plane are the things that tend to get banished more often than others. Humanoids of all races sure, but a staggering amount of demons and monsters. Before my people, the Manarahi, left the underdark, we were all subject to intense horror, as our mazelike tunnels were filled with horrors that other planes didn't want to deal with. You can ask Tarn Ravora about it, he was there. The surface is far more hospitable, hosting a nice array of climates despite its small size. On this plane, mistakes can mean death, and lines of communication between towns tends to be mercantile or magical exclusively. Travel is another way of saying death wish. Unless you're an adventurer of course. Hordes of hoards of treasured treasures from all over the multiverse gather here and build up in the lairs of dragons, in the ruins of fallen cities, and in the retirement funds of deceased adventurers who were once like you. Plenty to get, plenty of people to save. Plenty of books to find and bring to my library in exchange for //executive quality magical items fresh from the artificery. Manaharamu, the university, the big building shaped like a glass staircase facing south east. Ask for Nirrum. //**Speaking of which! **Such a plane obviously ends up with the (obviously second) most powerful mages. Mordenkainen, Tenser, Merlin, and all sorts have ended up here one way or another, and are all pleased to learn of the University of Manaharamu, the largest magical university  in many places (though not far from us is a plane so far advanced we can barely communicate with them). Dwarves flock to the Volcano of Skalmirthon for its rich ore, Pirates to grand tortuga for a good mooring ground. With over three million square miles of overworld and much much more underdark Wherever you come from, and wherever you'll go, Welcome! 

I am unfortunately sorry to say that your centaur friends are probably dead. The sun has a tendency to eat them on the way in. OH, and don't stare at the sun, it gets uncomfortable and we need it to chase away the moon. Don't stare at the moon either. **Don't stare at the moon. It's the ultimate proof that the gods are the worst parents. **

Some cultural notes worth putting forward is that our new year is on the first day of spring, a concept mostly purloined from other planes where it is far more reliable. Our seasons are a result of careful planning more than one of celestial coincidence for once.




==== Skalmirthon ====

	 The Dwarven-Drow-Sverfneblin underground city of really really great mining. Although Technically the city isn't underground as it sits in the Caldera of the great Skal Volcano, it never receives any weather other than "sunny" as the peak sits higher than any cloud can reach, short of rare cirrus wisps off the top. The city is powered by Deep thermal power, water is tapped from the springs inside the mountain walls, Food is often imported in exchange for the variety of crafts, mechanisms, machinery and raw materials extracted from the nearby mines, which tap into the volcano's rich ores.

	As of 5851, the city, having gone through two rapid government changes sits without a king and is temporarily under the control of the more influential organizations in the city. The Casino, Traders, and Church of Moradin.

	The city is host to great night life, and sports a variety of exotic drug trade, and a great many illegal activities to boot. Also fight pits. Plumbing mostly runs into a pit of Lava about three miles out, Vented in another crater well enough removed from the town that in the event of eruption, the town would be safe. 


==== Manaharamu ====

	The city-state and nation of Manaharamu is one of the grandest sights on the plane. Sitting on the east corner of the Kavir-e Namak Desert against the Mohara mountains, The city of Manaharamu has three parts. The Powerplant, The City, And The University.  It was Founded by the Mana People, one of the oldest civilizations on the plane, and its name is a triple compound meaning roughly "Magic Mountain City" or more literally "Energy Hill Place"
	
	Manaharamu is best known for its extreme production of magic items and its sale of spells, and such its trade is very lucrative. It runs under a constitutional monarchy, underneath which are a system of councilors and lawyers who work to benefit the people. 
	
	They are also famed for having invented the airship, which they use to move their militaries around, the range of many spells makes this prohibitively hard to defeat.


==== Kriegcove ====

	A small cove that makes up the only settlement on a large island off the west coast of Varomar. It is a dark place, both figuratively and literally, as the hills that enclose the town are often enough to block the sunglight, and the people have trouble smiling. Kriegcove is poor, dangerous, and unforgiving. It lacks a justice system and guards and is mostly made of the children of exiled criminals, with fresh additions coming in rather frequently. The houses are built poorly, usually in a rush, and frequently on top of each other. The closest thing to government are the gangs which simply kill those they disagree with.


==== Kholira ====

	The Kingdom of Kholira was founded When the Manarahi split during the long exodus from Mana Ulla. They were the ones who stayed the longest in their home until they were forced out by magical anomaly. They ventured far northward until they found a smaller leyline node nestled in the cold Ualakomara mountains. There they also found a secret. The yet-living but severed roots of the Great White world Tree who bound the plane together. With this discovery, they harnessed dark magic which fed on their emotions, their empathy, and indeed, their soul. The Kholirahi bound the roots to themselves, generational rituals slowly making it so that every Kholirahi child was born with visible roots under their skin. This has lead to a Dynasty of Druidic God-Kings who have harnessed this magic more and more. The Kholirahi godkings take a shotgun approach to their successors. Where the Great White World Tree Treysa was "female" in essence, her magical echoes are most tuned to men. For this reason, the god-king can only ever be male. For This reason as well, the Kholirahi are societally sexist, valuing men over women, making them one of the only systemically sexist peoples on the plane. The God-King makes as many children as he can in each generation with whatever beings he deems worthy of his seed. This frequently involves consort with all sorts of celestial, fiendish, or otherwise magical creatures. Many of the god-kings heirs are Aasimar, Tiefling, Star-spawn, Half-dragon, Cambion, and on more than one occasion, Empyrean. The nature of their birth does not stop the drive of their half-siblings, for all of the God-king's sons are doomed, save one, who is fated to slay all of his siblings. The women are poltically unimportant as they are universally defeated by their brothers should they ever try for power. 
		* **Nirrum's Note: **//Some women and some of the sexless siblings have been able to attune to the roots as their brothers have and though to my knowledge none have ever taken the throne, it is my duty as a teacher to encourage those who are not what they were expected to be to chase their full potential regardless. You are not a disappointment, you //**exceed expectations. **//Work to exceed your own and you will always be happy. Bonus points if you destabilize the enemies of the Manarahi. I've got a special magic item waiting for anyone who does//



==== Grand Tortuga ====

	Once a prosperous trading outpost, grand tortuga has been long overrun wiþ pirates, cutþroats, and unscrupulous traders for over a þousand years. While þere isn't a governing body, þere are groups and families þat one would do best to not cross. Þe city almost mirrors Kara'ite, as many orphans are taken up by þe more powerful groups to keep up þeir numbers. Turtle Culture is often friendly despite being reclusive. Visitors aren't welcome into homes, Bodies are never found, but bumping into someone in þe street is met wiþ smiles, 'excuse-me's, and apologies. Þe people live in perpetual politeness wiþ þe understanding þat þe arrogant are never seen again. Grand Tortuga hosts is own breeds of warrior, wiþ adept assassins, subtle mages, and creatively insane warlocks who have made pacts wiþ þe deep. Þe town is lined wiþ stormpiercers and modified versions þereof. Þe town understandably has þe finest fried seafood, as well as almost every trade good known to man. Þe Town is obviously not wiþout danger, quite þe opposite, a wrong step, a percieved þreat, or þe wrong word uttered can end wiþ disaster.



==== Danzuishan ====

	A collection of smaller towns amalgamated into one. Over time this place gained a prosperous economy, managed by over 9 town councils that bicker and squabble over every movement among themselves and the others. Originally, the townships were each their own pirate band, each ready to retire and settle down, thus, the Danzuishanese Navy was well formed from the beginning as a concillar militia. The most effective member of each militia tends to move up the ranks by nature of being good at their job. Each Militia slowly specialized over time to make themselves more valuable to the whole army, eventually, the original Danzi and Shan Clans were at the top, and in 2663, became one clan through a landmark marriage. Danzuishan boasts exciting spices, fish, and engineering. Their shipwrights are the best, and have often been contracted out to Manaharamu to build their airships. Danzuishan is the richest part of the plane, having great stability in its physical location and exports of wealth such as gems, gold, and adamantine	A collection of smaller towns amalgamated into one.

=== Ganglegrove ===
	Backwater shanty town, varied races. Runs through the Mangroves and brackish swamp of the Merrier Glades. Produces oranges, Spices, semi-aquatic game (crocs, Waterfowl, eel, Crayfish).
	No power. All water comes from eating Various fruits or simple stills. 


=== Mokoi Tha'am ===
	Githzerai, Hengeyokai, Elves. All excellent hunters in this jungle town. The town is built in the trees, not to avoid the dangerous beasts that roam the forest floor (there are many in the canopy) but to avoid the seasonal flooding and occasional mudslide. The town specializes in gathering exotic fruit and spices, like peppers, pineapple, saffron and cinnamon. Screens are a Necessity, as many spiders, snakes, and angry tree-dwelling mammals (and stuff) dwell in the mazelike canopy. Some Solar collectors have been installed directly above the town. They are shielded and covered to prevent damage which reduces their effectiveness.


=== Bladewater ===
	A human Whaling settlement on the cold northern shore. Permanent tents of fur and leather maintain heat fairly well on the cold shore. Freshwater is usually gleaned from the snow, because despite fishing for Kraken spawn, Whale and well...fish... The viking-esque inhabitants aren't stupid enough to go near the river for which the settlement gets its name. Vegetables are often shipped into the town via road or boat. Only one building has power and that's the solar powered Longhouse, which houses the chieftain, most people who don't want to spend the night in their tent (or are too drunk), the operations headquarters, and the dining hall and kitchens. The meat is stored underground in the locker. Has a clan and sept system, the clans are different villages unified in war. The clans are warrior groups following different schools of warfare, training together for years before returning to their septs. The clans are encouraged by the Kholirahi to wage war amongst themselves to ensure only the strong and battle hardened survive.


=== Pebblerpony ===
	Halfling Gardens, Dragonborn Port. Seaside town, part of a small inlet. Great Producer of beets, potatoes, and Lettuce. Wave-powered. Some hunting, Some fishing. Water comes from a hillside spring. Apples grow wild in the woods nearby,


=== Gearshire ===
	Wide shire-esque town. Mostly Warforged and Satyrs. Town lives in good harmony as the warforged rarely get bothered by the Satyr youth and the youths learn quick not to try. Powered by wind and (a rare) teslaharmonic crystal, that receives power from the Power plant on the mountaintop. The warforged in this town are among the few examples in the multiverse that can reproduce, but to the tune of lots of metal and a fully formed body as soon as the child is made.


=== Xia Ochiko ===
	Town built mostly on wood platforms spanning small islands. Lots of tall plateaus and mesas in the area within a  wiiiide river (wider than most cities). Wilden and shifters make up the majority of the populus. Lots of Fishing, some gold panning, Powered by waterwheels, though there's not much to talk about here. They don't even have a Xanaran's!


=== Mjoriskivor ===
	Mountain town, freshwater rivers run nearby, Road leads through town to deep mountain pass, then caverns into Skalmirthon. Well traveled, fairly large town, diverse populus.Lots of trade, rare goods. Powered by Small windfarm, Solar Collection station, and Thermal power from deep metal rods driven into the earth. They produce a very delicious Maple Liquer


=== Berpsin ===
	A Woodland town, Deep wells supply water, Woods rife with game. Also predators. Like Owlbears. Lots of Owlbears. I don't think you realize how many Owlbears can be in one place this time of year. There's a lot of them out there. Luckily they can't open doors. Town lacks power, except for emergency generators. Town has several accomplished medic acolytes here to collect herbs from the woods. The road that leads through the town is a simple path, may need maintenance. Side trail leads to a ravine that passes by a strange wizard's tower. 


=== Torniutr ===
	A low-lying Dwarven town, Volcanic tundra,some of it active. Smells of sulfur but you get used to it after a while. Powered by several thermal-based methods in the nearyby gysers and vents. Dwarves are collecting loose minerals to ship back to Skalmirthon for processing. Lots of Cheese production from local auroch-cow hybrid. Hot-springs nearby. 


==== Stalwark Stratocracy ====
	Situated in the Stalwark pass in the middle of the Aegis Mountain Range is the mighty Fortress of Stalwark, a Massive slope-spanning set of fortifications, walls, tunnels, and moats. Presided over by the old Lord General Mikao D'Fazore, stalwark knows little peace. It is beset upon constantly by monsters, Kholirahi, Furi, and, ugh, Rights activists. Made of deep-mined gabbro, The fortress walls are strong. Stalwark is well known for its special forces, its griffon-riding air force, which boasts enough threat to repel the air forces of Manaharamu, Kholira, and Danzuishan. Its long tradition of Sappers has made the area around it a treacherous maze of tunnels and pits. Ground forces dare not attack at all. The people of Stalwark are poor laborers, working tirelessly for their dictator, though they are raised to believe that he is working for their better. The truth is far more obscure, as D'Fazore is not a monster, but does fear losing his power. He doesn't consider the people's needs as much as one probably should, but he manages to maintain Stalwark through aggressive trading. 


=== Ilfea ===
	Hillside, terraced town, mostly elves, half-elves, and eladrin. Placed in the highlands, the sunset is wonderful there. Windmills in the plains power their village. Good beer, Sake, and wine. What is strange about Ilfea is that they are, for some reason, untouched and unbothered by the Kholirahi who live immediately to their north. They have a small nobility 


=== Marshfire ===
	Similar to inland Newfoundland towns, built next to a vast expanse of bog, where they get their bog iron, fish, crayfish, and gamebirds. Generators are run on oils, but only at night. Excellent wine from the local berries.
	

=== Varshelm ===
	Riverside, Similar to Helgen, Lots of woodsmen. Their Power is collected through several large solar-orbs throughought the woods, placed on top of marked trees to be of low profile, higher yield. Easy to repair, low total yield, good enough for light and heat and some machinery. 


==== Konia ====
	A Hexagonal fortification girds a degagramal series of ramparts and artillery. Konia is a large castle citadel with strict security. Konia has a failing economy due to its spending on weapons in the last war, all of which were made obsolete by Manaharamu's Aircraft. Sections of the city have been cordoned off to prevent the spreading of several plagues. Many predatorial races that are...less inclined to coexist with any sort of society in mind have come to feed or experiment on the people of the town...regardless of their mortal status. The current government, an army of Paladins, Clerics, and Invokers of a variety of good gods, have recently overthrown the previous despotic tyrant in place of a senate, formed by the head of each of these orders. Some mild political strife from religion has caused progress to be slow. The town is rife with history, but that may not always be a good thing. The oldest building in town is a massive (town-sized) Cathedral, ornate, covered in gargoyles, and claiming nothing toward any god, people rarely venture within. Outside the city are the ruins of old fortifications from wars fought, they are said to be haunted, and they are. The town sustains itself though, despite the hardships, on game from the haunted forest which has turned out both a multitude of corpses and incredibly skilled hunters, on its art and scupltures, and it's mass production of fine cloths, leathers, and still yet, arms.
	
Konia. Once, the largest human settlement on Varomar, is now reduced to a hollow shadow of its former self, over 90% of the buildings in Konia are Uninhabited or informally inhabited by things that really shouldn't be there.


== Morwerta ==
	Konian satellite Duchy, though quickly becoming the center of the Konian Civilization after the war of ants destroyed inner Konia ward. A rather Stereotypical Organized Aristocracy, though it lacks a Monarch, as all the nobles are trying to avoid tension from Manaharamu.


=== Ardeo ===
	A wizard’s Respite on the dry west coast, this isn’t a town so much as it is the eccentricity of a few mages with a small number of people mad enough to stay. There, the residents boast a finer understanding of planar sciences than the University of Manaharamu, which is bogged down with politics


=== Dwallat ===
	The Anarchic Kingdom of Dwallat is a Dystopic clusterfuck of sin, violence, and offence. "Ruled" over by a family of Teiflings, the vast underground expanse was pilfered from the dwarves by assaulting creatures of the darkness in the deep caves that riddle the Plateau in which they they had the misfortune to build in. Everything dislikable and Rotten seems to have gathered here in a pit of barbarism and hermitism. A lot of dragons have their hoards here, and a lot of people have died trying to get to them. Most of them not all the way dead either. Wild things inhabit the tunnels and sandy crags as well. Gricks and Liondrakes stalk prey here, and are often preyed upon by The Various Sphinxes that also guard treasure here. The city is unpowered but the dwarves were rumoured to be working on something in the deep before they were slaughtered. It is the ideal place to go if you want to be left to your own devices though, The Porous but strong rock filters out all noise, and easily disguised doors may house decent folk that had no where else to go. This is both the seat of power for the largest mafia in the world, and the self-proclaimed king of dragons Ujira


==== Kara'ite ====
	The merchant plutocracy of Kara'ite was built within a very deep pit to the south of Jianok sio, The pit's edges form a high barrier preventing water from the ocean that surrounds  it from entering. As time went on, people built pumps, and built a spire in the center of the pit to escape the occasional encroaching water or the slow rise from the frequent rains. eventually, the spire reached the top of the pit and people set up on the sea shore, but only those that could afford it. After many centuries, the pumps are breaking and those who can repair them have no need to. In order to even move around in Kara'ite, you need money, and those who need to move the most, those in the slowly flooding pit, are those who have the least money. The Merchant kings, The Svilsbo, Iyrelm, and Horton families try to keep their power and won't let anything move far without a cut.
	


==== Quire ====
	Previously another satellite of Konia, Quire Declared independance during the war of ants to avoid fighting a war on two fronts. Quire sits in the far northern regions of Konia's territory and is the primary supplier of the fortress at Clayman's point, which acts to interfere with Kholirahi travel around the north-eastern arm of the Aegis mountain rages. Quire established a monarchy rather quickly though they have worked hard to supress the idea of a democracy. Their dominant source of food are hardy grains like oats as well as meat from sheep and chickens. The kingdom aesthetically is very stereotypical of medieval europe and lacks an electrical grid entirely


==== Steinhaven ====
	Tucked on the bottom of the Thunder coast, steinhaven enjoys some of the heaviest precipitation in the world. Steinhaven is a dwarven mining settlement of the Gapendil Dwarves from another world, and part of the Manaharamu Protectorate. The Town is composed of two halves. A dwarven fortress buried under a rocky outcropping 200m inland. A Kenku-dominated town sprung up around it, built closer to the shore with some stage-heads built over the rough waters and made out of imported wood. The ones closest to the water are covered in barnacles. The Dwarves have no need of a breakwater and the kenku can never mobilize to build one, so docking too close to shore can be perilous. Steinhaven Fortress is deep-cut into sandstone. It has two entrances to the fortress and one to the tombs. In the deepest part of the V-shaped outcropping is the Main entrance. Halfway up the east side is the Trading outpost and Tavern. Rather early in the west side is the entrance to the tombs, Including the Tomb of the recently Deceased king Stehli Gahad.
	
	Built on top of the overhang is a few stone buildings, mostly merchants and one Fishery, as well as the Local Xanaran's.
	
	Outside, on the sandstone shore is the Kenku side of Steinhaven. Built out of wood hauled in from the jungle some two miles away, this part of town is squalid. The Kenku fishers and rangers largely just scavenge things that get attacked in the dragon forest. They manage to sell fish or game to the incoming caravans, but not much else.  This part of town is dangerous to outsiders. The dwarves don't care what happens here so long as it doesn't scare off caravans

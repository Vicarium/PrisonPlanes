Created Friday 16 February 2018

The Silver Sleeve is the name of the Northern Gannaga's Most infamous Denizens. A monastic tribe of Aarakocra of many forms. Many of them have bright plumage so unlike their more common Eagle-like bretheren. Their Modus Operandi is to swoop down on intruders, even ones much larger than they are, and to drag them as far up into the sky as they can in as short a time as they can before simply dropping them to their deaths and scavenging the remains. They are Xenophobic to an extreme and will likely make up a good portion of Random Encounters They live on roosts in the foothills of the area but their great roost is on the rainbow mountain, north of the Xia river in this region. They will not attack adherents of wild gods such as Silvanus or Cernunnos. Interestingly, adherents of the god Pan, Dionysus, and Bacchus are also not targetted. Some people who claim to worship Baphomet are attacked while others are not. The ones who are not are those who are exclusively from off plane, where that name applies to a different entity than the Demon Prince that is known of the abyss.

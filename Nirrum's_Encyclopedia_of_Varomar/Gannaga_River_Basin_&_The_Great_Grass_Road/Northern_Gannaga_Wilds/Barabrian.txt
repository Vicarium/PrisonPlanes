====== Barabrian ======
Created Friday 10 May 2019

An encampment of Barbarians that venerate their ancestors. The Barabrian claim they had heaven stolen from them by the fey. 

==== Tents ====
	The Barabrian live in large semi-permanent yurts in which they house themselves and their livestock. They mostly breed boar and hens and keep them around the outside of the yurts at night. The center of the Yurts is used for drying meats and as meeting places. Around a long fire, cot-beds are organized into two rows, one on either side. The Yurt's Centre pole is protected from the heat by a layer of mud and by having the fire go //around it. //
	

==== Fashion ====
	The Barabrian tribe rather uniformly wears long skirt-like tunics and vests as well as sandals with long-toe socks to prevent bugs from biting their legs too much. The fibre tends to be flax-based. They trade for green and pink dies which allows them to colour their outfits with wild dog roses, the symbol of their tribe. During a wedding, they might wear clothes with embroidered gold thread. 
	

==== Food ====
	Aside from chicken and pork, the barabrian mostly eat various berries and roots, (wild carrot, Ginger, Turmeric Dandelion, Mallow) from the land around. They are very swayed by barters made with salt and foreign spices
	

==== Fighting ====
	The Barabrian barbarians are all Ancestral Guardian Barbarians, Their highest ranking member is level 5 and uses a Falx(greatsword). To be an adult in this tribe, one must be at least level 3. Most people use pikes in this tribe.


==== Culture ====
	The Barabrian stand close to others when they talk, often standing in tight circles, not infrequently facing someone with their right shoulder touching the person's left shoulder. They believe in proving oneself to earn respect but will trade eagerly.
	
	Their chief stories revolve around one of their wars with the dwarves, another with the Firbolg of //Mobanka (//see, Monteblanca), and another about how the fey stole their heaven from them. The Fey are said to have tricked Asha, the Elder of the tribe after the war into sticking their foot in the waters of a fey river and the other on the ground of the plane to prove that it was possible to survive both worlds at once. When their foot was in the water, the fey cut off Asha's Leg and because of that, Asha and all of their children were stuck halfway into the feywild and couldn't leave the world fully.

====== Kemalabet_Brucheva ======
Created Wednesday 19 September 2018


**DM: Kemalabet Brucheva was arguably the cause of the schism between the Manarahi and the Kholirahi. Her variant of the lich ritual has been claimed by some to have set in motion the instabilities that drove the Manarahi out. She is bitter because of this. When the party enters the Throne room, she sits on the throne that is rightfully hers. She tells the party to leave. If someone is of 15th level or higher, she might talk to them. She takes consorts, every now and again, her last was a Copper Dragon Viintasklo who now lives in Danzuishan, but let it be clear, it takes a legendary amount of effort to move her heart and it is her heart that must be moved if you want anything to happen at all, other than fire and banishment. **

When wooing Viintasklo, Kemalabet wrote a song that lasted six years and killed forty people with its immensity and magical intricacy. The Result of their union was a half-dragon sorcerer, whose daughter is Slovenka Bruchev. ]

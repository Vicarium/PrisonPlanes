====== The_Desert ======
Created Monday 17 September 2018



	The Kavir-e'Namak Desert is one of the most inhospitable places on the continent. Much of it is simply sand. Loose coarse sand of notable grittiness and after even a few moment's journey, apparent omnipresence. The winds increase in strength away from manaharamu and dunes begin to form. Kavir-e'Namak is a salty desert, and water is not only hard to find, but frequently undrinkable. Only certain wells, grottos or Caverns contain lifegiving water. The sands cover much of this blasted wasteland, but not all. There are secrets, Protected places, and Secret routes that might allow one to cross.

===== Hall of Doors =====
	Buried underneath a broken-peaked butte, is the home of a introverted wizard, a master of The Transmutation school to rival or even surpass She-of-Iron-Nests, if not in power, then in skill. This wizard, whose name is unknown, guards the hall of doors. The hall is a low-roofed but kilometer long stone tunnel that leads to well over Two thousand rooms, each containing a small wonder or leading thenceforth from the site to other places, maybe  other worlds.  This is a spiritual place. If the Material plane is the balance betweent he shadowfell and the feywild, this is a harmonic of the two. Where the shadowfell takes, this place gives, and where the feywild overwhelms, this place calms.  Here, the Elements are remade, their energies turned upon themselves. Law is found in chaos, and chaos is found in law. Each of the early rooms represents that redivision, the later ones may have other uses. Fire that burns on water, an earthmote, bubbles at the bottom of a pond. **This is one of those places you take spirit journeys in**. 
	

===== Trackless Sand =====
	The Desert wastes are a reminder of what a war of gods really means. This salty and barren  sea of grit is the result of a war that shattered the continent and left little untouched. It has been left this way because of the weather patterns between The Aegis and Mohara ranges.

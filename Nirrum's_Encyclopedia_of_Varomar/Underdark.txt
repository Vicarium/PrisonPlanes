As with most planes, after the frost zone the temperature slowly increases, Each of the civilizations will have their climate listed as part of each, and Dungeons will, as part of their module, describe their own climates 



Cher-Mina Undercity
	A set of Tunnels into which hovels, shops, are simply carved. The undercity is complex and the largest Drow population on the plane. It passes through the frost layer and into an area which is approximately 13 degrees C at all times, the path to the surface is short and easy to find 
	
 Environment	
	The illumination levels are dim and the power is channelled from windmills above. Fresh water comes in from the nearby Gallery Canal through pipes in the riverbed. 
	Primary sources of food are Fish from the port and Drow Mushrooms. Some of the drow population takes particular pleasure in eating giant cowish spiders. The Drow have recently managed to get a hold of Rothe, a subterranean cattle
	
 Culture:
	There is a rift in the undercity, the native drow and many of those who end up on the plane celebrate their liberation from the spider queen lolth. Some of them still worship the Demon Goddess, and have much animosity to the rest of the people. They are all mildly intolerant of outsiders but most are civil enough

**In Late 5853, Konia falls. A small dettachment of the Kholirahi navy saild up the Rose Canal. No one who witnesses the event knows what happened, and next to none of them live but the Kholirahi soldiers spread rumours about bringing foreigners on their ship who carried an ornament, some sort of disc made out of what looked like part of a spine. Shortly after the New year, Three people show up. Nirrum the Mad, Karagan Barako, and Kotsi Kemadumana'ab. They hover over the lake investigating for a while. Nirrum Leaves, Kotsi and Karagan begin to **//fight eachother//**. When Karagan flees, Kotsi lingers for a day, studying. After which A solar under the employ of the Raven queen shows up and attempts to collect the souls of the Konians and the Crusaders. The collective will and religious fervor of most of the crusaders overpowers the solar, who leaves. Konia remanifests over the slowly filling lake as a ghost citadel. The people and spirits of this once great land, unshackled from permanent death, begin to come to terms with their half-death. Going within the walls of Konia means nearly certain semi-death for anyone who isn't powerful enough to withstand their judgement. Those pious to a god, save the gods of death and undeath, will also find safety in Konia. The citadel will not be convinced to allow others in. The Denizens of Konia still call it Konia, but those who enter and leave alive call it the glass city.**


The walls of konia are some 17ish meters tall,  human-mined and masoned stone, it's supposed to be about the size of germany but I need to redo my calculations because I think it's not. The outer walls guard farms and at one point, had  ten small cities, each at one of its outer points and another town at each of the convex points. These were farming towns and guarded the inner citadel, which was a massive city, also with the ten-pointed wall schema, Inside the schema was a typical human city. Sewers, chimneys, smiths that weren't quite dwarves but if a dwarf had the practice they had, skalmirthon would be better armed.  They boasted the largest and most well-armed martial force on the plane until the war of ants.  The innermost Castle echoes the ten-pointed wall again, and was a resplendent palace from which the last Monarchs of Konia watched their civilization burn

Now, Konia is a shell. What were once orchards are now filled with malevolent ghosts, but because once the fields burned they were still the best source of food, the recovering Konians have had to start using rangers to venture out and sneak past the undead to get what apples they can.

The fields filled with the shambling undead and more than a few wild magic zones. Those twenty outer settlements are barren ash
The inner city is the worst. Millions died over the course of a few days, only small patches near the walls and near the canals where fire lines could be maintained were spared
The Manaharamu aerial forces did not care, of course. This plane, as delightful as it can seem sometimes has a foul penchant for preying on the unprotected. It was probably less than a week before the vampires moved in, Mindflayers weren't far behind, crawling up from the broken layers below the catacombs to... well you've seen the baldur's gate trailer
In the central fortress of Konia, not too long after, a survivor of the war managed to find an artifact. I don't need to tell you what sort of artifact to tell you that the walls of the castle were quickly filled with thousands of undead
In the more ravaged parts of Konia, more than one rather unsavoury sort of necromancer has set up


A Hexagonal fortification girds a degagramal series of ramparts and artillery. Konia is a large castle citadel with strict security. Konia has a failing economy due to its spending on weapons in the last war, all of which were made obsolete by Manaharamu's Aircraft. Sections of the city have been cordoned off to prevent the spreading of several plagues. Many predatorial races that are...less inclined to coexist with any sort of society in mind have come to feed or experiment on the people of the town...regardless of their mortal status. The current government, an army of Paladins, Clerics, and Invokers of a variety of good gods, have recently overthrown the previous despotic tyrant in place of a senate, formed by the head of each of these orders. Some mild political strife from religion has caused progress to be slow. The town is rife with history, but that may not always be a good thing. The oldest building in town is a massive (town-sized) Cathedral, ornate, covered in gargoyles, and claiming nothing toward any god, people rarely venture within. Outside the city are the ruins of old fortifications from wars fought, they are said to be haunted, and they are. The town sustains itself though, despite the hardships, on game from the haunted forest which has turned out both a multitude of corpses and incredibly skilled hunters, on its art and scupltures, and it's mass production of fine cloths, leathers, and still yet, arms.
	
Konia. Once, the largest human settlement on Varomar, is now reduced to a hollow shadow of its former self, over 90% of the buildings in Konia are Uninhabited or informally inhabited by things that really shouldn't be there.

===== Urban =====
	The wedge of inner Konia between the rose and gallery canal and the spots nearby are the only spots of the once great city left standing. The garrisoned plaster buildings are very much Of a late-medieval/Renaissance style of Plaster and timbre. Older Buildings are Cobbled stone mortared in thick walls. The only break from these buildings are Intricate Gothic Cathedrals, Temples, and Mosque-like constructs built to venerate hundreds of gods. Most Notably, the gods most venerated are those of the dawn war, whose power was closest when the world was built.

====== Ctutoletl ======
Created Friday 28 September 2018

Situated inland from the dragon coast, south of Manaharamu but out of the way of the road to Steinhaven, Ctutoletl is a  Yuan-ti fortress. It is nearly invisible  from a distance, or even from above as it is covered in trees, but when you are nearby, it begins to stand out. A massive stone pyramid surrounded by smaller pyramids, all covered in thick-leaved trees, cordoned off by stone walls. These yuan-ti are always hostile, but frequently keep it a secret. They will always intend to either sacrifice a party or turn them into broodguards. 


**In 5854, Many Manahararahi become slaves or captives of the Yuan-ti, many become broodguards or food**

==== Outer Wall ====
	Despite their stealth, the wood around Ctutoletl is rife with pathways. These Paths reach their highest density around the wall. Within each section, the yuan-ti practice their craft. The yuan-ti only do the skilled crafts themselves, leaving the slaves to do the other ones in the slave pits closer to the centre of the complex.  Here, smiths, Potters, Glassblowers and weavers work their trade to supply the rest of Ctutoletl with finery. This part of town is protected only by the wall, the yuan-ti do not believe in guards until near the pyramids, where purebloods are commanded into servitude.

                                    

==== The Small Pyramids ====
	Standing around the central pyramid, just inside the inner wall are four smaller pyramids. Each made of Three layers of stone, each layer 10ft high. In each of these are temples to the Yuan-ti gods, Dendar, sseth, and Merrshaulk, with one pyramid standing empty. This last pyramid is a shrine to the world-spirit, A scorpion with a snake-like tail that seems to stretch infinitely across the cosmos. The Yuan-ti do not worship this entity so much as entreat it to ignore them.  Inside each of the three is a small cadre of yuan-ti priests, each of them the favoured of their gods. The world-spirit temple is a dungeon. The yuan-ti avoid the dungeon and are loathe to go onto its grounds, as the pyramid is surrounded, they can wait for creatures who try to escape there to come out.

	Between these lie the majority of the Yuan-ti homes. Wooden shelters on stone foundations in a short dome-shape. 



==== The Large Pyramid ====
	Mimicing the layout of the Yuan-ti pyramid from **Volo's Guide to Monsters, ** This pyramid contains the Yuan-ti Anathema and its closest servants at the top, just below the sacrificial altar. At the altar is where much of Ctutoletl's greatest magic happens. If there is to be a ritual or sacrifice, it is to be done here. This is where fell deals are made with extraplanar liasons and all sorts of magic foulness finds its way into the world.
		**Dm's Note: For an added bonus, Throw in a Marilith at the top.**


=== Treasure ===
Ctutoletl is filled with the malignant whim of the yuan-ti, and many of those whims are vanity, though not all. Almost all mundane valuables are found in sculpture and jewelry, with other pieces of fine art wrought from jewels and precious metals, sometimes softer things like rugs or comfortable hammocks. Other more intruiguing items are
	* An Alchemy Jug
	* Two Scrolls of Arcane Eye
	* Wand of Secrets
	* +2 Sacrificial Dagger

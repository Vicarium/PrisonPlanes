**Nirrum's note:**//The god-king of kholira is what some in the business of storytelling would call "a big bad evil guy"//

The Empire of Kholira was founded When the Manarahi split during the long exodus from Mana Ulla. They were the ones who stayed the longest in their home until they were forced out by magical anomaly. They ventured northward until they found a smaller leyline node nestled in the Ualakomara mountains. There they also found a secret. The yet-living but severed roots of the Great White world Tree who bound the plane together. With this discovery, they harnessed dark magic which fed on their emotions, their empathy, and indeed, their soul. The Kholirahi bound the roots to themselves, generational rituals slowly making it so that every Kholirahi child was born with visible roots under their skin. This has lead to a Dynasty of Druidic God-Kings who have harnessed this magic more and more. The Kholirahi godkings take a shotgun approach to their successors. Where the Great White World Tree Treysa was female in essence, her magical echoes are most tuned to men. For this reason, the god-king has only ever been male*. For This reason as well, the Kholirahi are societally sexist, valuing men over women, making them one of the only systemically sexist peoples on the plane. The God-King makes as many children as he can in each generation with whatever beings he deems worthy of his seed. This frequently involves consort with all sorts of celestial, fiendish, or otherwise magical creatures. Many of the god-kings heirs are Aasimar, Tiefling, Star-spawn, Half-dragon, Cambion, and on more than one occasion, Empyrean. The nature of their birth does not stop the drive of their half-siblings, for all of the God-king's sons are doomed, save one, who is fated to slay all of his siblings. The women are poltically unimportant as they are universally defeated by their brothers should they ever try for power. 
	* **Nirrum's Note: **//Some women and some of the sexless siblings have been able to attune to the roots as their brothers have and though to my knowledge none have ever taken the throne, it is my duty as a teacher to encourage those who are not what they were expected to be to chase their full potential regardless. You are not a disappointment, you //**exceed expectations. **//Work to exceed your own and you will always be happy. Bonus points if you destabilize the enemies of the Manahararahi. I've got a special magic item waiting for anyone who does//
	* **DM Note**: Snarl is a place of magic, the male-female dichotomy is merely a somewhat useful description of two general bell-curves that describe overlaps of other bell-curves. One can assume that the guy with orange eyes, blue skin, and the ability to speak to stars maybe has a different chromosomal and cellular composition to even some of the most closely related creatures.  For ease, The magic of the roots tends to match the Gender Identity of the person more frequently than any other characteristic that might define them. There are, of course, mismatches there as well. 

It is not hard for one of the Kholirahi to strip themselves of these roots. Usually it involves ripping them out. painfully but rarely lethally if done with any mind for medical safety.

The Kholirahi are entirely racially Half-elf, though they have subjugated orc and half-orc tribes as warrior-slaves. The Half-elves focus on their attunement to the roots from a young age, but may appear frightening to other races //(thus they gain +2 wisdom instead of +2 charisma)// Their government is made of druids of the circle of spores/parasites. Their common other warriors are paladins of the oath of devotion, retribution, and conquest. They have frequent Fighters and (Great old one) warlocks. Pyromancy is not uncommon either, frequently instead of being given bows, their recruits will be taught the "firebolt" and "control flame" spells.

**As of the fall of Manaharamu, The Kholirahi population booms and begins to develop villages around the Ualakomara. Many of the Manahararahi slaves were quickly swayed to the godking's cause, Many of them took the roots into their own skin as well. Because of their life and culture, the Manahararahi that take the roots form a new part of the army, and a new form of Kholirahi come to be, The Kholirahi-star speakers.  Sillig the Castle joins with the Kholirahi, finding their love for song and history is still intact even if they have no love for written libraries.**


==== Urban: ====
As a city, Kholira is a city of wonderous architecture. For each new neighborhood and building, a theme is taken, and often houses are part of the city's infrastructure. This was part of the Second God-King's Decree. To show that his power was intrinsic and not simply granted, the second god-king ruled that all buildings should be built in honor and to please the god king, and not with profit in mind. As is true of Kholira as a concept, there is an irony that the people prospered as a result of this decree, for no house is built unsightly, should the god-king ever choose to sleep in one. Thus, sweeping marble sculpture and magically formed streets both service and hide the homes of the poet people. Kholira is a quiet city. Pink Granite tiled with grey and accented with amethyst marks the main road to the Citadel. 

== Homes: ==
A Typical kholirahi home has five rooms. A large living room is always placed near the front door, furnished with cushions and blankets. Obtaining pigment and dye is hard this far north, so the most common colors of cloth and clothing are woad blue, golden brown, white, and purple that is harvested from coastal molluscs, to offset these unenergetic colors, gold, platinum, and copper thread is frequently woven into fabrics in simple patterns. Offset from this, radially, are usually a bedroom for adults and young children fitted with as many beds as needed, as well as a very small kitchen, barely taking up a closet. Wrapped around the kitchen closet it a room which is used for work, storage, or on occasion, housing important other visitors. Finally, in almost every home, not far from the kitchen closet, is a glass-roofed sun room, containing a small garden of nutritous and edible plants that the women of each house are expected to care for and bring to the local dining hall. Very Few homes in Kholira have Power, favouring magic instead. Because of the roots, almost all kholirahi qualify as first level druids after puberty, and many know the rituals to make a light, or snuff one out. Water is brought in through underground pipes, put together by slaves whenever a new expansion is made, this works for their sewage as well. Homes are built around public latrines, which are warm, and magically scent-free. 

== * Dining halls: ==
The Kholirahi eat mostly in large dining halls, as the third god-kings edicts aimed to promote a solid unity among his people.... and to keep better watch on them. People are expected to bring something to the kitchen for their hall-cook to turn into the day's meal early in the morning. The halls are circular, with the cook in the middle, among the scrutiny of peers. Children are placed at smaller tables in the back and mostly left to their own devices, despite the watchful eye of a lector, who beats them with a small crop if they start causing trouble. Adults are not allowed to sit next to the same person twice in a row, so often they will alternate between their spouse and their best friends. Meals are usually one portion of meat (frequently fish), Two portions of different vegetables. They are served with three drinks. One large mug of alcohol, any amount of milk or water, and one mug of a concotion mixed to supply nutrients to the roots that run underneath the skin of every Kholirahi.

== * Temples: ==
Kholirahi temples are exclusively devoted to their god-king who extracts tithe in the form of magic. In a simple, efficient ritual, once a week, each adult must repeat an incantation and extend their will to a statue of the current Godking. Ghostly roots, as the rudmages use to attack their foes, reach out and touch the statue, imparting roughly the equivalent of a first level spell slot from each person. If one is capable, you are expected and encouraged to give more. There is frequently a line, but it is a fast process, taking only about six seconds to complete if one is practiced.

==== Ecology: ====
Kholira is nestled into the north side of the Ualakomara Mountain range, and experiences the highest levels of precipitation on the plane. For a third of the year, that precipitation is snow. Despite its exposure to the winds, which follow from north to south, along the magically charged polar leyline, the winds are yet slow, and rarely crest ten miles an hour. Thus, the snow that falls is light and fluffy. In the summer, when the sun passes north of the aegis, the plants of the north undergo rapid transformation. The air becomes sweet with the sap moving up the slumbering conifers that are most indicative of the climate, and this little valley of Ualakomara becomes a radiant garden. The people who live here call it the god-king's warmth. It is not for even most of the year, but it is enough to survive and to prosper. In Kholira, it is said "to bloom so radiantly is the gifts given by so short a time." Berries of a great many varieties erupt around the taiga and tundra, and birds flock from the south to enjoy the feast. Caribou come as well, and yeti follow them. Mammoths wander this area all year long. A few Dragons, white and silver, nest up here, but they are rare, for they are much prized by the Kholirahi as meat, despite their protests. Elite Rudmages will hunt them ruthlessly. The land is scarred by the military activity, but yet, so close to the most dangerous place on the plane, hermits still live undisturbed in the woods around. 

Because of the cold, travelling without protective clothing, (traveller's clothes, heavy armor) will usually lead to death, though in the summer, it can get surprisingly warm and the lakes and ponds of the area become swimming holes for the people.


==== Economy: ====
There is not much to say on the Economy of a totalitarian socialist slave-driven dictatorship. The Kholirahi obey the godking and they do what they are told or risk his displeasure. A big-brother hierarchy forces the people to listen to authority figures, like temple priests and any rudmage of any level higher than them. There is frequently sociopolitical clamor as people try to remove those above them who displease them by appealing to higher and higher powers. This keeps the higher authorities better trained in dealing with such things. The displeasure of the godking is visited on people by whim. If a squabble grabs his attention, he may solve it by mercy, but more frequently, he will kill either one or both of the squabbling parties. Unity is lauded in Kholira, Division is punished.

Despite this, Kholira does have currency and the people are given an allowance. In Kholira City (which they never just call Kholiramu and I am still not sure why), there are very few places to spend that money. There's the Xanaran's, The Trading post, The fake Xanaran's, 

Kholira only trades with Kara'ite and Grand tortuga as a rule, though merchants from Kholira will travel throughout the world, often to the displeasure of their hosts, but with precious metals, exotic furs, their purple dyes, and rare wines, vinegars, jams, and sauces, they are frequently accepted. The Kholirahi make the best of their environment.

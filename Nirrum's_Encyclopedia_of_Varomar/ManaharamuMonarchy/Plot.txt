Depending on who comes here and when, Manaharamu has many plots, for my own purposes, this is it

The party is on a mission to root out the changeling cult. Their interactions will be wildly varied but this time they have a goal. End corruption in the university of manaharamu.

The enemy knows they are there and are tremendously afraid. 

The list of names given to Ridicully cosades reads thus

	* Metwiki Arzuban
	* Pimish Barwa
	* Ukog but not Imok
	* Manalece Milat
	* Wau!xorauch
	* Grom Ambershore
The list does not talk about these people who were also there
	* Alawabreolsh Ravora
	* Skaha (Scathac) Skye
	* Taduralo Kolat
	* Ignvar Auldane
	* Karagan Barako
The List also does not mention Kotsi Kemadumana'ab, The current Archmage who isn't even a Methuselah, but is in fact the current manifestation of Teruna, The Crying Demon. He was spawned from the left hand by cultists, drawing part of the essence of the mind of Teruna through the cracks in its prison.  

Despite the presence of Kotsi, Metwiki is actually the face of the cult here, while Karagan Barako does most of the plotting
* the cult will do anything to maintain their power at the university of Manaharamu
* The cult is not in a good enough position to take over the university entirely,

The Cult operates on these main rules
* they can only cast spells that they know against the player
* They only have two out-of-their-ass magic items total
* They cannot actually kill anyone while Kotsi is in Manaharamu, as the power of Teruna prevents them, not just stopping their attempts but robbing them of their murderous intent
* They get one free revive
And the Cult also follows these guidelines, which they are far more likely to subvert or break
* They do not like the Kholirahi and avoid involving them
* They cannot rely on their allies in Grand Tortuga
* They Despise the Furi outright
* They do not like direct confrontation and tend to get others to do their dirty work


Pimish seems to have been the one to convince the investigators that Ridicully disappeared in a failed experiment in the main hall.  He had modified his memory several days prior and had nystul's magic auras set to look like memory modifications that got hit with standard dispel magic practices. 

The cult is fairly organized and together

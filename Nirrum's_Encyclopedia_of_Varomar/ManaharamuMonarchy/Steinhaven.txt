====== Steinhaven ======
Created Friday 19 October 2018

**Barely changes from the fall of Manaharamu, though many Manahararahi begin new lives here**

Tucked on the bottom of the Thunder coast, steinhaven enjoys some of the heaviest precipitation in the world. Steinhaven is a dwarven mining settlement of the Gapendil Dwarves from another world, and part of the Manaharamu Protectorate. The Town is composed of two halves. A dwarven fortress buried under a rocky outcropping 200m inland. A Kenku-dominated town sprung up around it, built closer to the shore with some stage-heads built over the rough waters and made out of imported wood. The ones closest to the water are covered in barnacles. The Dwarves have no need of a breakwater and the kenku can never mobilize to build one, so docking too close to shore can be perilous. Steinhaven Fortress is deep-cut into sandstone. It has two entrances to the fortress and one to the tombs. In the deepest part of the V-shaped outcropping is the Main entrance. Halfway up the east side is the Trading outpost and Tavern. Rather early in the west side is the entrance to the tombs, Including the Tomb of the recently Deceased king Stehli Gahad.

Built on top of the overhang is a few stone buildings, mostly merchants and one Fishery, as well as the Local Xanaran's.

Outside, on the sandstone shore is the Kenku side of Steinhaven. Built out of wood hauled in from the jungle some two miles away, this part of town is squalid. The Kenku fishers and rangers largely just scavenge things that get attacked in the dragon forest. They manage to sell fish or game to the incoming caravans, but not much else.  This part of town is dangerous to outsiders. The dwarves don't care what happens here so long as it doesn't scare off caravans.

====== UniversityOfManaharamu ======
Created Monday 08 January 2018

Running against the University masters is problematic, so it looks like this, 
**HP: 111+1d6**
AC: 18
+ 9 con and +15 main stat, +3 dex, + 2 other caster stats
They cast most spells from their own domains
They know a lot of spells.


**The University of Manaharamu is largely intact following the siege of Manaharamu. The Golden tower is absent and the magic items gone completely, The grounds are perpetually roved by busy undead who seem intent on delivering items to the Archmage's tower or the crypts. Many of the roofs have holes in them and scorch marks dot the area. Being the most well defended and the easiest to evacuate, most of the students are alive, but are fairly dispersed. The Majority of them enroleld in the University Of Skalmorthon**


===== 1)Main hall and host of the School of Abjuration =====
The main hall is an impressive, large room where large functions that interact with the rest of Manaharmu take place. The Department of Abjuration works out of here mostly, as it is a prime spot to show of flashier magic without endangering the public. The hall hosts a small stage and benches folded to the side on most days as well as a large board on one wall, detailing whatever the last lesson held there was. The walls are a golden-stained wood, streaked with real gold and glowing blue resin. The floor is a dark green adventurine tile, while the ceiling traces the map of leylines on the plane, green lines on black. It is a static image and does not change, the compass rose sits on manaharamu. 

	Metwiki Arzuban (wizard 17) (ISFJ)
		A wood-elf who Excels at discerning the delicate nature of spells.
		Hieght 4'5
		Weight: 130
		Age: 607
		Metwiki is perhaps the only Head of a department that isn't mathematically inclined, but instead Uses Magic like a hammer, having a highly organized system of tricks for Undoing magic. She is quiet, but her voice carries well around her lecture halls. She is conservative in her views and wishes for stability. She tends to do things by the book. She wears light blue robes with pink flower embroidery, her eyes are green. She casts with a wand
	**Alive and with the cult**


=== In and arround this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Adder Blackwell (Wizard 10)(INTP)
		A strange human who is never without a snack or a way to shut down spells
		Height: 6'1
		Weight: 160
		Age 24
	Adder is a tall, thin man who dresses like a common laborer. He can always be found eating and for some reason his skin gets darker the further away from his chest it is. His wand is made from elf femur, and he refuses to say where he got it.



	Cora Thorngage (Wizard 5)(ENFP)
		A halfling who is as likely to abscond as abjure
		Height: 2'11
		Weight: 36lb
		Age: 25
	Cora is a bright and cheerful halfling who fights fiercely to protect those she cares about. She is slow to trust but quick to act. Some would say she has a great wanderlust others would call her unfocused. Were she the religious type she'd have probably made a good paladin. Her hair is always messy and she always seems to be late for something. Despite her protective instincts, she does not care for trouble and will leave if she has no stake in a conflict.

	Oldest of 7, Longbeard Shieldbearer (ISTP, the crafter)(1 level of cleric, tempest) (6 levels of wizard, abjuration)
		He carries the name of his ancestors and their duties with pride. It's a heavy burden but thank the maker the dwarves are stout.
			Age: 78
			Height: 4'1
			Weight: 160
	Longbeard is even by dwarven standards to be a bit petty and hold grudges for far too long.  However, that being said he also remembers and holds onto whenever someone does something nice to him probably long after that person leaves. His memory is razor-sharp and damn near photographic. He works not only with wizards but other dawi and those who need an extra shield on their tasks. Some might question why on earth a wizard would carry around a warhammer and be dressed in full plate mail with a shield at almost all times of the day, but most know not to mock a dwarf in full battle garb.
	
	
	"The Conniving" Urkk Snol (INTP) (Abjuration, The Kraken) (Wizard: Abjuration 10, Warlock Kraken 2)
	“A bored Githyanki with your perdition on his mind”
	Age: 28
	Height: 6’ 11”
	Weight: 215 lbs.
	
	Urkk is seen as an odd loner that seems very passive with little resistance despite his size. Most try to avoid his tall, thin, and tired body along with his cold stare. Urkk despite his appearance is very attentive to everything around him and tends to figure out the easiest way to break something apart at the seems for both his entertainment and his patron. This ability isn’t only material as he also has a high aptitude for countering or dispelling magic with minimal effort. His pockets are filled with counter formulas and fragments of things he’s proud of having eliminated. Most of the time Urkk merely pays attention to his schooling and studies only to practice what he learns for his patron upon his inevitable escape. As a new citizen of Tu’narath it didn’t take long for him to be bored and eventually fell to The Prison Plane on assignment. Something just feels right as he manages to ruin something that was made to be permanent or at least long lasting. His attire is general uniform for a student at Manaharamu with an unusual amount of degradation and grease for such a student. Most often he prefers to dress in a gaudy mix of crimson and navy blue which just looks nasty to gaze at. Along with his standard collection of junk in his pockets he has a +2 Rod of The Pact Keeper made from driftwood and blue sapphire, a +2 Wand of the Warmage, and a single Ring of Spell Storing kept around the middle finger of his left hand. Urkk has always been fascinated at seeing the undoing of organized systems or objects and when trained in The Astral Plane it was sadly never put to much use, but he was always excited to land on the material plane to begin tearing something apart. As most found his passion “disturbing” or “odd” he would prefer to do his examination away from prying eyes.


===== 2) Storehouses and the Grand Circles of the School of Conjuration =====
	The location where the magical items are kept under heavy security. Here, most of the magical circles that lead to the Tower of trade are stationed. By necessity the school of Conjuration is separated by adamantine walls from these stores as often dangerous entites are summoned to the area. The Floors are dark blue sodalite, and Enscribed with magical circles of gold. The walls are glamored to display the magical theory behind the next lesson, black text on white
	Pimish Barwa (Wizard 17)(ESTP)
		A drow whose command of Magic is matched only by his smugness
		Height: 5'0
		Weight: 130
		Age: 180
		Pimish is proud of his mastery and will constantly berate and lord over his students. Despite this, he will willingly accept criticism and constantly drives to improve himself. He talks shit and respects people who talk shit back. Confidence is key when dealing with this drow. His eyes are reddish brown. He wears purple robes and his hands bear silvery sigils seemingly embossed on his skin. His hair is short and white, and his chin is pointy. He casts with a staff

	**Prisoner of the godking. Tortured. **


=== In and arround this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Pepiskwi Munen (Wizard 7 INTP)
		A timid white Dragonborn whose summons go pop
			Height: 5'11
			Weight:  190
			Age: 25
			Pepiskwi is an oddity in that for some reason, every time he casts a conjuration spell, there is a loud popping sound. He hunches slightly so he always seems shorter than he is. He wears an old set of white robes decorated with the image of a lion in Pink. He uses a wand he made himself out of Gnu horn, which is a hard material to get used to but very versatile. His frill vane  is tatooed with  the equation for thaumatic index
			



===== 3) Orrery of the School of Divination =====
	The Orrery displays the local planar landscape and how it interacts with the planetary bodies of the Moon and the Sun, as well as the locations of the "fixed stars." in relation to the plane. It is a huge machine built of brass and glass. It requires a minimum of 14 intelligence to even understand the motions, not just a DC. The prison planes rotate in place, showing the facets of their non-euclidean geometry mounted on dodecahedral cores. They are hard to understand and even harder to contact, and the construction of the orrery was the result of over a thousand years of Planar research that lead to more than fifty fatalities.  Along the walls are minitature effigies of all the gods who show active influence in the plane, emitting increasingly bright light in octarine based on the god's presence. **As of the year 2585, three new gods have been added. The Erdshaka, an orc-like god of the Kuo-toa, who represents the musical arts, drugs, and Impressing your enemies; Skal Welch, The volcano reborn, a devilish CN god of invention and revealing secrets; and The Runner,  a Vague humanoid form with five eyes, orc-like teeth, Wings, a tail, large curved horns, and a drum. Behind the runner, in the hollow where its effigy sits, are the reaching tentacles of the eldritch seeker of perfection, who wishes to abduct the runner. ** The glass floor sits on top of the machinery that drives the orrery, and on occasion, artificers can be seen below, adjusting the systems to fit the major theories. **The entire faculty of the School of divination and all its students can be found at the university of skalmirthon, having moved there nearly a full year beforehand**

	Priscilla Morgani (Wizard 19)(INTP)
		A very fat half orc who seems to know what's up 
		Hieght: 6'0
		Weight: 400
		Age: 39
	Priscilla likes being a teacher, and like all divination heads, she just showed up one day. She wears large green robes, and has a shaved head and almost never shows up to class. She frequently uses glyph of warding to manipulate serfs into teaching her classes for her. She Casts through an orb from quite a long ways away.  Running into her is never an accident. On occasion she will magic herself back to good health but is usually far to lethargic to begin the ritual. She is extremely calm, extremely hard to anger and extremely apathetic to most things that aren't puzzles. She frequently uses scrying to entertain herself by watching real-life drama around the world.
		**If the party reaches the City by 2585, Priscilla has stopped showing up and no one wants to replace her. No one will say why. See **[[ManaharamuMonarchy:Plot]]


=== In and arround this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Parinn Myernetec (Wizard 14)(ENTP)
		Red-dragonborn with long whiskers and missing his left eye.
		Hight: 6'6
		Age: 59
		Weight:263
	Parinn is a talkative scholar who does nothing without consulting his star charts first. He wears light blue robes and has all his whiskers decorated with rings and coins. He carries around a massive blunt claymore which he has turned into a staff with the guard redesigned to look like a constellation.
	**Moves to umlil orill. **


	The Studious Layabout, Askhyr Altings, INTJ, College of Divination, Magic College of Manaharamu, Level 9 Divination Wizard
		The path to omniscience is long, slow, and easy. At least, it should be for this elf.
		Age: 261
		Height: 5’2”
		Weight: 254
	Askhyr is a figure that few pay little mind to, often found hunched over a book or scroll deep within the confines of the library. In fact, it is incredibly rare to find him anywhere else, including classrooms or laboratories. Askhyr is known to actively avoid those settings, instead choosing to read through whatever books catch his eye. He avoids most spellcasting and skirted off studying more as soon as he could. He wants to learn everything, but long ago decided that he would just do it at his own pace with a minimum of effort. As a result, the only real wizardly effort that he puts forth on a daily basis is various spells to aid in reading, unseen servants to fetch more books, and the occasional use of Legend Lore for particularly annoying to find pieces of information. His search has no rhyme or reason, nor a broader goal, but it has made him the unparalleled expert in obscure and often unimportant trivia. Askhyr’s rather sizable form is covered with a shabby robe and other typical wizardry furnishing. The only item which sticks out is a large beat up helm of comprehend language, used to save him the spell slots or the extra 10 minutes. Askhyr despises impositions on his time, and will often snap at anyone who bothers him for much more than a quick question.


===== 4) Classrooms, where you'll find the School of Enchantment =====
	As the School of enchantment requires the most theorycrafting and has the smallest classes (owing to an incredibly dense screening test to keep the corrupt out), it tends to stay in the standard classrooms, without a particular department building. Most of the spells made here are on a personal level, they effect individuals and connect the students to other people, They allow for a higher level of communication without the need for complex machinery or otherwordly beings, making for effective devices in therapy. These classrooms, white-walled, tan floored, well-lit,  are all  filled with rugged bean-bag chairs and adjustable tables. two thirds of them have windows, the central line does not. The Classroom building is made of three floors, each with fifteen classrooms. Students from any school can be found here, but the Enchanters are //always// here.
	




=== In and around this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===

	Imok/ukog (Wizard 13)(INTP/ESTP)
		An Ettin with clashing personalities, one calm and serene, one eccentric and loud.
		Height: 6’10”
		Weight: 387
		Age: 40
	An ettin whose two heads are both wizards of vastly different personalities Where Imok is a patient and intent listener, Ukog is a loud and obnoxious asshole. Imok has Blue eyes while ukog has green eyes, and together, they wear a robe which is light blue on one side and black on the other. Imok casts through a wand, Ukog, through a staff.

	
	Llewellyn Penry (INFP ) (School of Enchantment) (Wizard/School of Enchantment LV10)
		A laid back and caring student of enchantment magic seeking to help anyone he can.
		Age: 25
		Height: 5'6
		Weight: 154 
	A laid back and caring student of enchantment magic that speaks in a very casual manner with slight welsh accent and treats everyone equally. Has a very laid back personality and view on the world which causes him to be very lazy when it comes to most things. Yet he seeks to help people to the best of his ability so to do this he is studying enchantment magic with the goal of working at the Medica as a counsellor for those in need.Due to the lose of finer control of his arm he tries to keeps his right arm hidden and as still as possible so as to keep the pain to a minimal but will when he believes no one is looking test to see if there is any improvement. "
	

===== 5) The Adamantine Stages of the School of Evocation =====
	The Adamantine stages are one of the most modern parts of Manaharamu. Small windows line the top of the one-story building, about 20 feet at the ceiling, letting in ample light to scatter on the enchanted white brick walls.  Along the floor are seventeen pale green platforms raised about six inches off of the walkway. They are made of an alloy of Adamantine and Orichalcum. While extremely expensive, they are functionally indestructible and will probably remain where they are until the stars burn out. Soft noise cancelling tiles line the ceiling, heavily warded against the explosive acts below them. At the end of the walkway is a door leading to a square staircase, leading up thirteen steps to a landing and then another thirteen steps. This room has two sides of it made of glass held by square brackets. The top floor consists of a single, cluttered office, the seat of the head of the department of evocation.

	Ridicully Cosades (Wizard 19)(INTP)
		A half-elf with a temper to whom magic is like breathing
		height: 5'6
		Weight: 211
		Age: 50
	Ridicully was born into an extremely magical extraplanar family known as the cosades. Upon earning his right to the name, he decided to study magic, very much taking into account the praise he'd get for his comparably high talent among the non-cosades people of Manaharamu. He believes in raising up the poor and educating others, and often spends his money on the social services of Manaharamu. He does have a soft spot for whisky but he is tempermental and reckless. He wears a blue coat over white robes and black pants. His brown beard is large and well groomed. He casts with a long straight wand of ebony which is inlaid with gold forming the words "Mishali Nnera Kao'a"


**As of the year 2852, Ridicully has gone missing and is quickly replaced by Wau!xorauch**
	Wau!xorauch (Wizard 15) (ISTJ)
		A cloud giant who cruelly and disdainfully instructs students into regretable rages
		Height: 23'7
		Weight: 5058
		Age: 247
	Wau!x is the replacement for Ridicully Cosades, the previous head of Evocation who vanished mysteriously in Spring of 5852, just after the new year. He is a passionate wizard but less powerful than the others, and perhaps not suited for this position, he was, however, the only one who applied. He wears a green iridescent vest and off-black pants. He is otherwise unclothed. His long white hair stands 0perpetually upward, swaying in some unseen breeze. His Eyes are lavender. He does not need an implement to cast without material components.
**as of 5854** **Wau!xorach is in hiding from the servants of Amarok and the Cosades family. Ridicully Cosades Returned briefly as Head of destruction, and now is an advisor to Deloch Welch**

=== In and around this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Jasop of Rogi (wizard 9)(INFJ)
		A human that is quite the hand at making big spells
		Height: 5'5
		Weight: 250
		Age: 17
	Jasop, an offworlder, came to Manaharamu via caravan five years ago. Only  child, they were not allowed to join the university proper but their unstoppable resolve found them in the library a lot, after following the ranger school in and out of the campus day after day. Upon Turning 15, they were already an accomplished blaster caster and was accepted into the university without tuition, having essentially already been there for three years.
	
	 


===== 6)The Indoor Auditorium of the School of Illusion =====
	The largest Auditorium in the school, and host to its largest shows can comfortably sit the entire student body, up to five thousand people at once. The seats are arrayed in a wide arc, with folding stadium seats. In front of the stage is an orchestra pit and access to the understage. This is a theatre, and was built as one, but the school of illusion relies so much on presentation that it appropriated it before the college of glamour was even established.
	
	Edgar Frottenhammer (Wizard 19) (ENTP)
		A giggly high elf with more talent than sense
		Height: 5'5
		Weight: 147
		Age: 360
	Edgar is an eccentric extrovert who delights in the idea that everything ever is wrong. He seems capable of proving it. He has long dyed-blue hair in a ponytail with red roots showing. His eyes never remain a Specific color, nor can anyone seem to agree what color they are at any given time. Those who can see octarine, the color of magic, are absolutely positive he wears extremely conservative robes which seem unrealistically heavy for the weather. Because Everyone at the university  or who works on the university staff can see octarine, very few people realize that to the vast majority of the world, he appears entirely naked. Discipline councils brought to him in light of complaints are unable to address the issues, as to them, he is obviously clothed. Professor Yallali is the only other person to have caught onto the ruse. He casts with a rod....We think.
	
	**Died during the siege. Turns out it's hard to fool eldritch abominations.**
	edit: **Probably**
	

=== In and around this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	 Omen Darefill (Wizard 5)(INTP)
		 A Doppelganger who is here to be entertained
		Height: 5'4 
		Weight: 120 lbs
		Age: 29
	A quiet and introvert, Omen gets along well enough with the master illusionist. Omen is just in the university to learn more about magic and to entertain himself, by extension, he's actually quite good at learning. He wears a Green robe and does not frequently change his appearance, despite his race and profession



===== 7) The Morgue and Laboratory of the School of Necromancy. =====
	The Morgue is a deep crypt used for the animation and experimentation upon the dead. The Manahararahi have an opt-out policy on donating your body to research. The Morgue has seven layers. The top layer is simply a crypt with bodies arrayed in cheap coffins around pillars, buried approximately 20 feet under ground. The air is magically scent-free in most rooms thankfully, and the crypt is ventilated.  At the end of the first layer is the office of Garhun ten-cages. In His office is a dial, which he can turn to descend deeper into the crypt, wherein hordes of undead under his control dwell, making note for his long-running works, most of the people that have ever died in Manaharamu are here, with the lowest layer being people too powerful to revive without full ressurections. The Presence of the Raven queen on the plane, while diminished in her worship and occupied in her power, prevents Garhun from being too reckless in raising subjects back to life, and he sticks to shambling animates.

**The School Of Necromancy is Mastered by**
	Garhun Ten-Cages (Wizard 18) (INTJ)
		A dour-looking skeleton with a stiched-skin face who wants people to take things seriously
		Height: 6'1
		Weight: 22.5
		Age: Unknown
	Garhun Ten-cages is, presumably an aasimar who is naturally long-dead. They do not appear to have a phylactery or any form of ritual to keep their essence from departing this world. Their bones glow a gentle yellow. They are rather unhappy with the existence of Edgar Frottenhammer and Pimish Barwa, as the two elves do little that  isn't also joke. Magic is serious business. A hard grader and an unforgiving person in social situations, Garhun is none the less an amazing wizard. There is a suspicion that they have been replaced several times, but as with most wizards at such heights, it is hard to tell. They wear a dark tattered cloak over their bones and little else. They cast with actual components when they need to.
	...**I hesitate to say alive and well, but sapient and functioning works. Garhun corroborates with Kotsi on some ritual currently**


=== In and around this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Gamberchamps 
	I have no idea where his stat block went, but he's in there somewhere
	


===== 8) The Gold Tower That Houses the School of Transmutation =====

**Re-established in Ardeo**
	Considered the pinnacle of Magic's usefulness, The school of Transmutation brings in may of the university's students and a fair chunk of its income. It is housed in a golden tower, first to contain the occasionally apocalyptic magic that originates from therein, but also as a display of the University's prowess. The tower stands at 36 meters tall and is capped with a piece of brownish lead-glass. The tower is the tallest building in Manaharamu from its base, though the castle sits higher uphill and the Power plant is on top of the mountain. 

	Transmutation wizards in the university have a great and honored duty. To take items of lesser value and reduce them into other spellcrafting components. Frequently this produces the diamonds needed in resurrection rituals. Only Wizards of the 14th level or higher can achieve this and it is considered the most valuable thing that the university does. For this they are granted a place in the University's scroll of Progress, inscribed therein are all those who contributed significantly to the field of magical study. The Scroll of progress is also a standing list of people to resurrect if shit hits the fan. This duty has the added effect of stabilizing the economy on the plane, being largely responsible for the lack of inflation on the plane despite the constant influx of people, goods, and high-value treasures. The use of these components in spells also helps ammend the occasional antimagic field by flooding the plane with large amount of excess unused mana. The lead-glass cap is a testament to this, as it reflects octarine exceptionally well, and stands as a beacon to casters to remind them that knowledge comes at a price, and it is our duty to keep paying it. It effectively glows in magical light, eclipsing the sunny shine of the gold upon which it stands. Knowledge trumps physical wealth, and if it doesn't look pretty to you, then you probably don't belong here.
	
**The School of Transmutation is mastered by:**
	She-of-iron-nests  (Wizard 20) (ENTJish)
		A sapient, Enterprising, and powerful swarm of wasps with many queens to whom the world is putty
		None of these other stats matter as they are highly variable
		Age: The oldest Queen is currently 2 years of age, though, is that really a good measure? The phenomenon is just over 3000 years old
	She-of-Iron-Nests is an anomaly, Born in Mana Ulla during the height of the city's power, The wasps that compose her are constantly casting transmutation magic on the entire colony to not only awaken but control it. This cycle of control cannot even seem to be broken by antimagic fields as it is so tightly woven, much as one might find on an artifact. She-of-iron-nests thinks in alien patterns and uses parts of the nest that compose her to cast spells. She usually sends a golem, one of her queens or any organism nearby that she might awaken to do her work for her, and spends her time doing deep philosophical research while yet learning to truly control the true world. She deeply enjoys the company of All of the other Masters except perhaps Metwiki. Her Lust for knowledge is countered only by her ambition and constant existential pondering


=== In and around this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
		
	Grom Ambershore (wizard 6)(ESTJ)
		An ambitious dwarf with an eye for Investment
		Hieght: 4"5

	A Dwarf of fine wealth, with a thick red beard braided and pinned to the side. He dresses decadently and stands tall. He is trying to learn how to turn his family quarry in to a gold mine though magic. He uses a pouch for his components. In his station in the tower, there are a great many types of mundane rock.
	**Dead before the siege after being interrogated by Ridicully. Currently his body is stored in a barrel somewhere on the astral plane**

	Name: Ulla Copperpocket (Wizard 16)(INFP)
		A gnome with a knack for magic and a fear of failure
		Height: 4'0"
		Weight: 60 lbs
		Age: 33
	Gifted as a child, he never experienced real failure until well into adulthood, and found himself unable to really cope with it. As a result, Ulla often comes off as incapable or perhaps even lazy. It's not that he can't do the work, he's just afraid he might let others down. Aside from this debilitating fear of failure, Ulla is generally very kind and speaks with a distinct stutter when excited. His wild black hair is tamed only by a pair of goggles, which look like they could pop off at any moment. He is a little overweight for a gnome. He uses a wand of hickory.
	
	Name: Qylan (Wizard 14)(ESTP)
		A Tabaxi who just wants to Live, play, and learn
		Height: 5'10 
		Weight: 190

===== 9) The Cold Field for the Circle of the Arctic =====
	A Druid grove mimicing the sparse taiga around Bladewater. It is cold, snowy, and frequently stormy despite the warm weather of Manaharamu. The druids gather outside of Alawabreolsh's home, a yurt-igloo combo with a dug-out enterance. The frigid weather means that one must wear protective clothing before entering the cold and sparse forest.  The cold allows some special spells to be tested, but the university doesn't see as much value in this circle compared to the others.

	Alawabreolsh Ravora (Druid 14) (ISFP)
		A solemn and tired looking human with pointed teeth accompanied by a wolf dragon
		Height: 6'7
		Age: 780
		Weight: 153
		Once a great hunter, Alawabreolsh hails from near Bladewater, though most of her family were Manaharamu natives. She wears an extremely shiny fish scale shirt from her home. The scales are tough but light. Her hair is light brown. She much enjoys gossip and her Wolf Dragon, Skoofy, is an absolute sook, but despite that, they are a fierce pair. She casts through a meteorite
	 
	**Alive and in Quire. Was revealed to be a cultist just before the siege,**


=== In and arround this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===
	Rime (druid 5)(ESFJ)
		A Massive wolf whose breath is like winter winds and who wants to protect his village
			Height: 5'0 (paw to shoulder), 
			Age: 4
			Weight: 480kg
			One of the Sapient wolves that hail  from Welton, just north of  the Mohara range, Welton was blessed with the uncommon mutation that his pack sometimes gets, obtaining cold and breath resistance not unlike Dragonborn have. He is excitable and loves to meet people but deep down has a sense of duty that will not go unfulfilled. Unlike the other druids, he does not seem to need a focus. He gets along well enough with Skoofy but treats him like a human would treat a dog. Not Rime nor any of his family can communicate the complexity of their thoughts with other wolves
	**Alive on the Sanity islands**


===== 10) The Aquariums for the study of Circle of the Coast =====
	The Aquariums  are  eight large pools, each a druid grove made to emulate the climate of points around the coast with distinct environments. They are mostly cared for by new students, as more advanced students get teleported down to an area just outside of Sha'at Dar. The aquariums contain many rare coastal fish and creatures, many with alchemical uses.
	
	**Using Duur'Kala Shek's magic, the entirety of the circle of the coast's students were brough to Shaat Daar. Only the druids were brought over and only the druids are allowed to stay there, as the hobgoblins do not welcome outsiders**

	Duur'Kala Shek (Druid 15) (ESTJ)
		A Hobgoblin witch from Shaat'daar, with an unforgiving attitude toward her students
		Height: 5'10
		Age: 67
		Weight: 150
	Shek is a terse and demanding instructor, but her knowledge of the sea has given her amazing power. She is fair but will demands high competence. She wears thick green robes with a thick lapel creased sharply and evenly.  She casts through a conch wrapped in steel wire

===== 11) The Dormitories and Equipment shack for the Circle of the Desert =====
	These are mostly just dorms near one of the gates, Each room is ten by 15, with some larger rooms for larger students. There are six thousand rooms in all in six buildings. Each building is four floors tall, and houses a thousand each. The Equipment shack, attached to the dormitories is mostly just desert-suited travellers clothes and a few druid implements, canteens of water, and similar objects. The Circle of the desert is the sort of McDruid School in Manaharamu. Manalece isn't even the most powerful circle of the desert druid in Kavir e Namak, but he is the one that got hired. The others tend to stay out in the desert, doing deserty druidy things.

===== 12) The Fairy ring of the Circle of Dreams =====
	A circle of mushrooms that leads into the feywild, and stranger places from there. The school of enchantment makes use of the circle of dreams the most, being particularly attracted to the workings of the mind. The two tend to go hand in hand
	
	Neviharath (Druid 14)(ISTP)
		A wild Kalashtar who frequently turns into a butterfly
		Hieght: 5'11
		Age: 40
		Weight: 154
	Born of the realm of dreams, and aptly suited to understand and interpret them, Neviharath serves as one of the University's prime envoys to the fey, alongside Aralc who //is an archfey//.  He has dusty but dark brown skin and slightly darker brown short curly hair. He wears red robes over a brown shirt and pants. His eyes are blue. He casts using a staff of camphor

===== 13) The Enchanted Grove of the Circle of the Forest =====
	Tall trees dot the bottom of Mohara where it meets the grounds of the but dark brown skin and slightly darker brown short curly hair. He wears red robes over a brown shirt and pants. His eyes are blue. He casts using a staff of camphor university, the sun's light is always golden here, the moon's light is always silver, the moss is soft, and in the center is a solitary reflecting pool that is about two feet deep and ten feet in diameter. This is the grove of the circle of the forest. It is similar to the forests both near stalwark and just west of the Skal Volcano, with great redwoods being the standout trees. Cair uses the pool for divination as it is a powerful focus for such magic

He casts with a Wand of Sasafrass.

**The circle of the forest still stands and Cair dubrek still teaches from there.**

===== 14) The outdoor Auditorium for the  Circle of the Grassland =====
	In bordering the great grass road, Manaharamu's second most prominent druid circle is the circle of the grassland. The druids like to lecture outside and thus, the appropriate "grove" site is more of a grassy lawn in the shape of a small amphitheatre. It is  rarely used except for introductions. 'Neatsumiku  tends to take his students out to the grass road, in part to fight the threats on the plains, but also in part to secure and understand it with them. There is much room for spiritual improvement on the steppe, and even some overtaxed wizards take this soul-searching journey.


	'Neatsumiku (druid 14)(ISFJ)
		A burly burlap-wrapped halfling who is hard to spot in a crowd, let alone the steppes he calls home
		Height: 3'3
		Age: 40
		Weight: 85
	'Neastumiku does not need to be seen if he does not want to be seen and he is exceptional at remaining hidden. His lessons, are often audio-only as he maintains a low profile. He has hazel eyes and tawny hair under his burlap wraps. He is adept with a bow but mostly casts through a wand made of Sabre-toothed tiger tooth. He is enigmatic, and comes from the Ramishi tribe that wanders the great grass road. He has been the savior of many caravans and people who find themselves introduced to the plane upon the steppe south of the aegis mountains. He has chosen to not stamp out Broomb's Orcs because they are a great force in culling the Breetu Gnolls that roam the plains, keeping his own people safe. 

	**The surviving druids, including Nneatsumiku can be found wandering the grass road**

===== 15) The Mohara Trail and the base of the Circle of the Mountain =====
	The Cirlce of the mountain starts its instruction at the base of the trail that leads from the university to the power plant. They walk from bottom to top, and from there, they walk north, outside of the city and into the wilds of Mohara's harsher terrain. The mountain serves as a great teacher of survival skills, as well as place to see great beasts. Several metallic dragons roost on Mohara. The city's proximity makes it easy for them to find treasure and to maintain connections and novelty.  For the druids, this place has far more meaning. This is where it is said that silvanus stood in the battle againt orcus, Where he stood when he corrupted pelor's work, and where he physically departed from the plane. This is where it is easiest to speak with the world spirit, described as scorpion with a long tail that wraps around the plane. Such information allows the other archmages to tailor their spells for the planar climate much more easily.

	Nauthiz Faultfinder Kagum (Druid15) (ISTJ)
		A Goliath from the Aegis mountains with a stony heart, hide, and disposition
		Height: 7'9
		Age: 39
		Weight: 240
	Nauthiz knows life on the mountains. He knows the smell of dew on baked stone, the feel of warm up-rushing clouds, and the sight of the first droplet to form a river. He has many lithoderms that he is a little self-conscious of, despite them being natural for goliaths. His eyes glow a pale yellow and he wears rather thick leathers. Unlike the other heads, he tends to spend his time and teach his classes up on Mohara. He casts through a gnarly piece of Tea tree wood

===== 16) The Pens and Fields for the Circle of the Shepherd =====
The University has an understandable collection of unique or rare nonsapient creatures, they are kept by the circle of the shepherd, and their services were the first to be called for by the once all-wizard school. Even though their domain is over beasts, they have a hand with monsters as well. The druids here learn about the beasts themselves, not just where they live. 

	Taduralo Kolat (druid 14)(ENFJ)
		A half-elf who loves cats
		Hieght: 5'7 
		Age: 61
		Weight: 160
	Taduralo surrounds herself with cats of all breeds and sizes, She is close with Thrain, as their teaching domains overlap heavily. She has dirty blonde hair and purple eyes, and wears simple Green shirt and brown shorts. She casts through a sprig of mistletoe
	
	**Destroyed by Kotsi. Taduralo's animated head sits on Kotsi's Desk and is used as a pen holder after their collusion with cult was revealed**

===== 17) The Duck Pond of the Circle of the Swamp =====
This standing pool is a placeholder for the actual grove of the circle of the swamp, which quite a distance to the east. There is an intense biodiversity in this little pond, as it hosts far more than ducks. This Circle was created second, when the university realized the potential of having the druids around, especially when they already had one on hand. Atsilo Walag was the first druid to stay at the university, though it was mostly as a guide for some dangerous areas.

	Atsilo Walag (Druid 20)(ENTJ)
		On average, a human. On occasion, anything
		Height: 6'0
		Age: 800, Appears 30
		Weight:  200
	Atsilo was found as a child on the borders of ganglegrove by University explorers when he was very young, as was the university. He was already a second-level caster. He wears a snake-skin shirt and has his loins girded with linen. He is an intimidating man, and few aspiring druids ever take hs courses, but those that do learn valuable skills in not dying around the most dangerous regions of the continent. He casts through whatever he can find, he is exceptionally good at improvising.

**Reestalished in ganglegrove**

===== Circles of the Underdark, Spores, and other druid circles =====
	While the university has budding interest in the circles (and indeed, all of the druid schools are around 40 years old) of all druids, it does not yet have programs for them. There appear to be no entrances to the underdark from Manaharamu after all, nor does the climate allow most fungi. The University is of course hiring for these and willing to consider new applicants
	**Nirrum's Note:**// The circle of Chicago is an entirely valid druid circle, even if Chicago has lacked magic ever since the cataclysm. Those Mystical beings that peer into the realms of magic from afar would not harm this world to predict who would be the next archdruid of the circle of Shopping malls, for example. In My strangest dreams, I have seen men made of worms and shadar-kai take up these positions, perhaps in other echoes of this reality. I should study more later//
	**Tetragrammaton, Head of the circle of Parasites/Spores, the guy made of worms Was last seen in the library before it disappeared. **
	
 

===== 18) The Adamantine fort of the Circle of the Moon =====
	The university was cautious when accepting a position for the circle of the moon, but it Skáthac proved effective with lyncanthropes and in training adventurers who showed promise. They built her a fort, reminiscent of her home, which does well to keep her happy.
	Scáthac Skye (Druid 14/Fighter5)(ESTJ)
		A fiery human who is more prone to making heroes than druids
		Hieght: 5'6
		Age: approximately 600
	Born in a world she cannot return to,  Scáthac (Skaha) is loathe to take on students, but those she does take on are oft bound to become great warriors. She wishes more than anything to return to her home, the fortress of shadows on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. She wears Little, preferring to remain topless at most times. She does not take kindly to those who sexualize her, dealing with such people violently. It has been requested she stay within her Fort in the Druid's quarter. She is known to transform into a giant raven. It is not known what she casts with, but it is certain that she does. 
		**Nirrum's note: **//It is a shame what happened to that plane, they had such promise until the abomination passed. Earth, not too disimilar in name from Oerth, was a plane of great mysteries, one that we here at the university occasionally catch echoes of. A great monster, not unlike the ones these prison planes were built for, passed through and ate the magic out of it, casting it into permanent silence from other worlds. On occasion magic leaks in, but is often used by accident in run-of-the-mill day jobs or by natural processes. It may never recover. Skáthac may never see her home again. //
		
		**Re-established in the ushlubarel River basin. **

===== 19) The looms, Theater, College of Glamour, and Department of Arts =====
	The facilities for the College of Glamour have always been present, even wizards require such things, but it wasn't until my sister Aralc heard they were looking for Bards that the place really got it's style! Many casters are able to channel their magic through their creative outlets, Sorcerers in particular, and there's nothing wrong with having an Archfey on campus.
	Aralc Sivad (Bard 18, Archfey)(ENTP)
		The Summer Archfey of Eyes is known to grant nightmares in the form of one's own faults
			Height: 5'10
			Weight: 220
			Age: Every instrument of observation except history seems to suggest 29.
		Aralc is one of the Archfey, and Quite high on the hierarchy. She is the incarnation of the spirit of irony, roasts, and Parody, and as such, it was her will that finally tore the last of the Manarahi from mana'ulla, and sent them northward to become the Kholirahi. She has yet to forgive them for what they've become. Her students learn much and become much under her, largely the presentation aspect of being a bard. Her best students are legends in and of their own right, and are groomed to behave in a way that will never see them kicked out. She has a commanding presence, and is of course,  a masterful warlock patron. She Wears A black dress of her own design, with a sheer of orange gossamer, Ornamental chains and long tassels**. **The Ensemble is slightly revealing, a winding gap in the fabric spanning the whole piece vertically, but showing nothing. Her instrument is a choir of fey that accompanies her and obeys her thoughts. By some quirk, She seems to be much younger than a very provable history would suggest while also being the older sister of Nirrum the Mad, despite being different species. There is some suspicions that this is a result of fey magic or trickery but those are largely racist and unfounded accusations with no basis whatsoever. Her hair is purple with dark red tips, her eyes constantly shift, her skin is pale, and Many of her features match the rest of the family. She can frequently be found in the Scriptorum. She speaks with a soft but melodic voice of medium high pitch

===== 20)The Grand Arcane Library, Home of the College of Lore =====
	The Grand Arcane Library of Manaharamu is the pride of the Manahararahi, and indeed the plane, and most importantly, myself. I have worked so hard to gather this knowledge and I will not have anything damage or corrupt it. I have a good hoard of magic items locked behind rituals of my own design for those who bring me lost knowledge, or destabilize the enemies of the manarahi. I have at least fifty bags of holding here. I can also cast wish, so if you need someone brought back from the dead I can do that. //What I'm getting at here is that I can pay for books and knowledge. Perfect Quest. Come. //
	
	Nirrum the mad (Bard **20**) (ENTP)
		Clearly the most handsome and **clever** caster at the University, which is why they cannot seem to lock him away
			Height: 178cm, no I'm sure this is a better system
			Weight: 771Dg, Look they're all multiples of ten, this is clearly superior
			Age: 28 The second I am able to break a year into multiples of Ten and still wake up in time for my classes I will
		The best person on the plane, Nirrum is absolutely not too Eccentric to be allowed to write an encyclopedia and certainly not narcissistic enough to include himself in it in any way that is anything other than impartial. The master of the college of Lore is actually one of the most active masters at the university, constantly trying to complete his "True Lore Encyclopedia." He wears Green Cargos, a collared shirt and a blue housecoat, despite the request of many people that he dress more //professionally. //He has brown hair, and green eyes, and a well defined jaw.//. //His students must be proactive, as he is absentminded, but he seems to have an answer to every question asked. These answers might not actually answer the question, but will always make someone think about the importance of the question being asked. He also seems to be able to turn anything into an instrument, much to the bewilderment of people who find him casting high level spells with empty inkwells and drinking straws. Despite this talent, he carries an accordion. He is perpetually looking for this [[..\SpecialMagicItems.txt|lost coat,]] but can usually be found in the theatre. He waves away accusations of corruption in the university when considering that the bard colleges are run by his family and friends. Few people pursue the matter, for some reason. He speaks in a smooth and mildly hypnotic but enthusiastic mid-deep voice for which he has been told he should be a "radio host" by extraplanar entities.

Instead of letting this get him down it instead gave him a great interest in stories which lead to a love of learning. He came to the college seeking magic secrets and powerful spells. He dresses humbly and has many pet birds often perching on him, but is often chastised by Nirrum, as such creatures are not allowed into the library without sapience.

	Murphy Nordstrum (Wizard divination 4)(INTP)
		A human who didn't make a good parent but makes a decent wizard
		Height: 5'9

**Off-plane, escaped with artifacts from the museums**

===== 21)The Scriptorum, Presses and College of Satire =====
	The Scriptorum is where one goes to turn scraps into books, where one finds freshly made spellbooks of custom design, where one finds the standards that allow Manaharamu to pump out the number of spell scrolls and wizards that it does. Here is where you'll also find the harshest criticism. Yeliab has made a name for himself in being able to subdue great foes.
	
	**To the DM: IT'S YOU.** **Spell your name backwards, give yourself 18 levels in bard and two levels worth of bonkers to play with. Give yourself a title and make a special magic item. You have an ungodly amount of money in exchange for being nearly irrelevant to the plot. Make yourself as much of a non entity as you can. If you don't wanna do that or you're already on here, use this guy.**

He is a master drummer, and thus, frequently does not need anything other than his surroundings to cast. He wears a Loose shirt, a light pink haori, and shorts. He can frequently be found in the Gymnasium
	
	**reestablished in Skalmirthon**

===== 22) The Gymnasium of the College of Swords =====
While not used too much by wizards, there was enough of a demand by students to include a Gymnasium. Sports, workout equipment, and the college of sword all call this building home. My brother, Sillig, is a fiend for legends, and will not let old ways slip into obscurity. It is thanks to him that we know so much about the Mana Ulla incident even after two thousand years. He was born a fighter but his love of stories is what made him into a bard. He can tell you much. He can teach you Quickly. Most importantly, this is where many of the //Gish //students train, Eldritch knights, Arcane tricksters, Spellsingers and the like.

	Sillig the Castle (Bard 18/Fighter 2) (ENFP)

He wears a cotton tank top, Black gloves and black pants and weilds a longsword through which he can work his magic. He is hard on his students and does not pull punches but takes great pleasure in a new story or cool technique. He is not nearly clever enough to realize that the Charm placed on him was a ruse to disguise that his Quills have all been enchanted to not only keep hitting him with charms but also only sign his name as "The Eel." He has a cursemark of the Raven Queen and seems to Enjoy it and its effects. He can often be found in the grand library, as he is a historian by hobby. He speaks in a slightly deep voice and.

	Mastermind and enforcer of a rogue village. 
	Physical attributes: H: 5’11” W: 520 lbs. Age: 32, physically 19
		Physical description: Appears to be a well-muscled Tiefling made out of various mixed stones like jasper and marble.
		Short Paragraph: Most that meet her assume that she is a weird construct or stone work demon. Her often expressed scowl and domineering attitude don’t change it to any extensive degree. Kagvek is a warrior that has been blessed by the light of The Citadel as a child in hopes that she would become a stepping stone to building new order in The Prison Plane. Currently she is the head of a small village located far from others trying to keep it alive and thriving. It’s almost impossible to find her not wearing her shimmering plate armor and some suspect this is to hide something underneath. Many say that she has the eyes of someone much older than herself and it wears away at their spirits. Her most prized items are her gauntlets of ogre strength and adamantine war hammer.  Her countenance is described as unbreakable and unyielding no matter how severe of a beating she’s taken, though she still experiences moments of weakness in private. Her guidance and knowledge are well respected and even though she appears harsh she can be pleasant if you prove yourself a worthy ally.


===== 23) The Parade grounds and College of Valor =====
The parade grounds are where the University's events are held, especially Tournament duels. There is nothing quite like two casters pitting their abilties against eachother.  The college of valor tends to practice here, as their stories must reach the most people in the shortest time. They also manage to make the duels more interesting, frequently interfering with healing and guidance to both sides. My friend Revilo has a great talent with reaching people and listening to them, so it is always a treat for others when he has something to say. 
	Revilo the Shrike (Bard 18, Fighter2)(ENFP)
		A soft spoken but high spirited Human who actually earned their position
		Height: 6'0
		Age: 28
		Wieght: 184
	Revilo was brought in for the college of valor when the old one passed away. He places emphasis on his students to record deeds, and to lift others, rather than to perform such deeds themselves. Revilo is a master of many instruments but prefers to cast through a bass, with which he can stoke the fires in many warriors. He has long brown hair and wears a white overcoat with dark green shirt and pants underneath. He speaks in a slightly-high windy voice.

===== 24) The College of Whispers, Baths =====
I only found out that we have a college of whispers recently, they're pretty good. You won't actually find them at the baths but you might spot Yma relaxing in one of the Saunas, maybe in a sunbeam. Mostly, She'll find you. She is the master of our spy network, which we also apparently have, and more informed than anyone who isn't from the college of lore has a right to be.
	Yma the quiet (Bard 18) (ISFJ)
		A tabaxi that actually applied as a painter
			Height: 5'1
			Weight: 150
			Age: 24
		A bitey, flighty and whitey Tabaxi with purple eyes who sleeps in a cat bed on her desk. I am assured she has a desk somewhere. The college of whispers expects such behavior as its aspirants are intended to be self-regulating, and thus they read their instruction on the board and leave at their leisure. She is stubborn and quick to become noncommunative. She casts with a staff with a series of bells hanging fom it. The bells are actualy what she casts through and each does something different. She wears a different outfit every day. She rarely speaks but when she does her moderately pitched voice can be resounding

	Smiling Vic is perhaps one of the most reassuring and unreassuring people you will ever meet on your travels. He's fair looking, overall nice, smiles all the time, gives a firm handshake. The perfect politician. His record is as clean and gleaming as his teeth. Of course, both are because he sees specialists to make sure both stay absolutely flawless and that no one can actually find anything wrong with him. Most people find him to be a pretty normal politican, but those who are deeply inbedded into politics know just how dangerous that smile can be. He's not afraid to use others and to be underhanded to go roundabout ways of making sure that his policies and personal goals come out on top.

===== 25)The Workshops and Hospital of the Department of Artifice and Trades* =====
 Should the DM allow it this requires "The Artificer" from Nirrum's Encyclopedia of Varomar
The workshops are the second pride of the university, after the library of course. This is where most of the University's money comes from. When the University was founded, Oghma saw fit to grant us with a great boon, the angel Yallali. He carried with him the secrets of many forms of magic. For this we granted him land upon which to build a temple. Instead he built a workshop, and made a new type of mage. The Artificers are those who study not the secrets of magic, but its application and function, their lack of theorycrafting means they end up learning some tricks slower than wizards but their output can be far more helpful. 

	Yallali (Artificer 17, Angel)(INTP)
		An angel of Oghma, and extremely busy.
		Height: 5'8
		Weight: 150
	A lavender-skinned Angel with an open-backed red robe. On his back are sigils displaying wings, and indeed, that is where his wings sprout when he needs them. They are gold and black feathers.  He has his head shaved. Yalali is the caring but almost robotic-minded professor of Artifice. He is quiet, he is creative, and he has the backing of the god Oghma

**Active, Intact, The artificery and temple of Oghma was unsuprisingly an airship as well.  Currently airborne.**

===== 26) Admissions, Administration, and Department of Pacts =====
Shagati is a **legend** for us faculty. Manaharamu is used to dealing with warlock problems in lethal and violent manners. This guy shows up looking like an angry pimple in a kindergarten incident and prevents, **seven different diabolic invasions in the first month**. He is an astute lawyer and a master negotiator, capable of resolving the most fickle of contract disputes in such a way that no one leaves angry. We know he has a pact of his own but he refuses to say with who, though I suspect the fey. He and his people handle the admissions and the tuition for the university as well. He's also put more than a few books in my library that needed to be there. Shagati also seems particularly capable of shutting down Demonic invasions single handedly, and for this we suspect his patron has granted him spells unique to those situations. 
Interestingly this is in the same building as the School of Abjuration. 

People are allowed in and out of the university at will, but they need to have a reason. Valid reasons are
	1. Enrollment
	2. medical services
	3. access to the mohara mountain trail
	4. recruitment of university faculty,
	5. Access to the Library
	6. Artificer commission

	Shagati Furnace (Warlock) (ENFP)
		A tiefling with long hair in dreadlocks of dark brown **5852: hair is now short and slightly coifed**
		Hieght: 5'3
		Weight: 161
		Age: 37
	A muscular but short tiefling who is not only capable of filing paperwork properly but is somehow able to make  friends with most creatures that would become patrons for warlocks. Because of this talent, he was given the title of Master of Pacts, and because he has saved the university on more than one occasion, he is paid well. He now has several underlings so he has time to advise warlocks on how to use their pacts and appease their patron in a way that benefits them and others. 

	**Reestablished in Skalmirthon**


=== In the Department of Pacts you can find NPCs such as ===
	Harlowe Lovrić (Warlock 16)( NFJ)
		A human who Found peace in lovecraftian horrors from beyond the stars
		Height: 5'6"
		Weight: 150 lbs
		Age: 52
	Harlowe is your weird aunt that found Jesus at 22, except instead of Jesus it was the Great Old Ones. Softspoken and kind, Harlowe is interested mostly in reading and making interesting new incense to burn, but when she puts her mind to a task you can be certain she will accomplish it no matter the cost to her. A bit of a martyr personality. Cloudy grey hair cut into a pageboy style frames a well-weathered face and turns into a short braid at the back.


===== 27) University Dungeon and Department of Sorcery =====
The Department of sorcery is by necessity kept deep underground, unless a young Sorcerer's powers go wild and cause a chain reaction or damage more careful experiments. Sorcerers have inborne magic, and thus can only be taught how to control and manipulate it, but by its nature, it is difficult to study as each power source is unique to the individual. Karagan has lived a hard life, and honestly, it hasn't made him a better person. There is no denying that he has a fundamental understanding of magic that is only rivalled by the Archmage, Kotsi Kemadumana'ab. The dungeons are some of the most warded areas on the planes. Once in, you are not getting out. Magical trick locks, solid walls, magical cyclers, huge thaumatic field generators to prevent any magic from being cast at all. A great deal of thought went in to preventing people from leaving this place.  Karagan keeps a wine cellar and cheese cave down there as well. 

	Karagan Barako (Sorcerer 20)(ESTJ)
		A wide eyed and spooky looking Changeling who looks down on failure
		Height: 5'11
		Weight: 173
		Age: 44
	Karagan is a necessity at the university. Perhaps the most powerful sorcerer on the plane, Karagan has written more on magical theory than some of the wizards. He is frequently at odds with Wau!xorauch, though the reasons are often unclear. Perhaps they just don't get along. Karagan believes that anyone who fails to achieve their best isn't trying hard enough, if he lectures a group he is invariably a raging ass. In private soft moments, he can give some of the greatest insight that the person he is talking to, usually custom tailored to dealing with their problem. He will be back to a raging ass seconds later. He enjoys red wines and can even cast through bottles and glasses.

**Cultist, escaped.**

=== In the Department of Sorcery you can find NPCs such as ===
	Ingvar Auldane (Sorcerer 17)( INTJ)
		Almost entirely human Ingvar's bronze skin is contrasted by  goat legs, cloven hooves, and a slimy prehensile tail
		Height: 7'8"
		Weight: 220 lbs
		Age: 80
	Ingvar is a series of poor combinations rolled into one. He's ambitious but lacks drive, well-spoken, but brutally forthright. He seems to think that with enough snark and bitterness, one can cover up past mistakes. Bronze skin with age spots blossoming on the top of his balding head. Has a dark brown goatee striped with grey that comes to a devilish point, and a well-groomed moustache of which he is very proud.




===== 28) Office outpost of the Department of Ranger Studies =====
My other sibling! We.... May have pushed him out on a raft down the Gannaga river on the day he got lost.  Ranger Studies tends to be more hands on and more wanderlusty than wizardry or druidism, and the rangers tend to simply gather up, talk to a few druids and a few wizards before heading out  into the wilds. The Rangers have a few tricks up their sleeves that make them worth having around, and are always willing to be guides and indeed, soldiers. 


	Keenan Stonefist (Ranger 15)(ESFP)
		A rowdy hero who is Intimidated by his family, despite standing on his own
		Hieght: 6'0
		Weight: Like, Six thousand million pounds. Fatass
		Age: 25
	The Youngest Brother of Nirrum the Mad, Aralc Archfey of Eyes, and Sillig the Castle. Keenan was lost as a child and adopted by the Stonefists, a family of Mostly Tieflings that hailed from Danzuishan. He Came to Manaharamu after many years of Travelling the world over all its domains, becoming a hero of the people of the steppes, the rivercourse, and the inland of Konia's domain. He decided he wanted to teach //his // magic and //his // way at the university. It was only after applying to the old Archmage and being accepted that he found out that the rest of his siblings were all master bards. Sillig was the first to notice. Keenan sometimes thinks that he is the weakest of his refound family, and while level might suggest that, not one of the bards questions that he contributes his own force. He shares their gift for storytelling, and is most certainly family. The Cunt. He is loud, and obnoxious, but caring and far more present about other's feelings than most of his siblings. He is Adept with a bow and is accompanied by a Gargantuan Magical Weasel named Samadhi.

**Escaped, established near Konia's ruins.**

===== 29) Temple =====
**Whatever temples I had planned were almost certainly targetted first**

=== In and arround this part of the school, you'll find NPCs such as ===


===== 30) Archmage's Office. =====
	Every Archmage decorates their office differently. Located at the top of a mahogany and ebony staircase in the Archmage's tower, you'll find a dimly lit room that has no wall  that is not covered by scroll racks and shelves except for one large round frosted window with bars in the shape of Manaharamu's eight-pointed Star, Inset with the university's Seven-pointed star. Kotsi has done away with a desk and simply stands at a podium of wrought iron and brass where he simply writes scrolls all day long unless he is needed elsewhere. The Archmage's tower is guarded by Iron golems on the inside and magic on the outside. The tower is alabaster and quite a bit shorter than the gold tower of transmutation. Moin, the previous archmage was a good man, but this new guy, he's something else. I deeply respect Kotsi. He is a product of eldritch magic, and I have no knowledge of how his birth happened, but I am glad it did. He is more willing than anyone to disperse information. He spends his days writing scrolls, though he wanders the school and can be found anywhere, Asking questions or giving answers, maybe setting up a few experiments of his own. The other three floors of the Archmage's tower contain a meeting room, a kitchen, and the archmage's bedroom which has gone unused and thus unchanged since Moin Matur's death.
	
	Kotsi Kemadumana'ab (Wizard 20)(ENTJ)
		A Methuselah whose hundred skeletal arms have written seven thousand scrolls and whose sixteen eyes see much more than light
		Height: 8'0
		Age:42
		Weight: 210
	Kotsi Ascended as the archmage in the spring of 2583 succeeding the recently deceased Moin Matur, after the other candidate for Archmage had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. He is a master of the wizardly arts, floats slightly above the ground, and seems to command otherworldly magic. He wears a pleated black skirt and leaves his pallid and nearly skeletal torso uncovered.  He only has a small fringe of copper hair, as his Sixteen eyes march well up onto his rather long forehead. His mouth is a jagged gash of interlocking tooth-like plates extending from his skin. He has no lips but seems to have no issue speaking eloquently and clearly.

**Intact, Upset, Kotsi is furious at Pimish for overstepping his authority and recognizes that the preferential treatment from the cult was because of his ties to the creature Car'Teruna. He despises being used and is working on a plan to take revenge at the destruction of a civilization he was partially in charge of.**

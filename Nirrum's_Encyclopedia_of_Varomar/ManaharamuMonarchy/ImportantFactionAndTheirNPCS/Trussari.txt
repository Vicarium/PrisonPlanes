====== Trussari ======
Created Wednesday 12 February 2020


The most powerful fighters in Manaharamu. While they were ineffective compared to and against Konia's Silver Knights in 2532, they excel against magical forces like the Kholirahi. Trussari are elites, and to even become a Trussari you need to be at least of 6th level (Showing more aptitude than extra attack, or in functional terms, being capable of a certain level of skill and having interesting techniques).  Magic is a detriment to a Trussari, for they are given a symbol on a talisman, usually a ring, armband or amulet that radiates an antimagic field for ten feet around them which disintegrates if it ever leaves their body or if they die. The Trussari are the answer to threats that the mages can't beat or would be particularly endangered by. 

During the fall of Mana Ulla, some Manarahi left to head west, Moving into Drakenhearth. While in Drakenhearth they developed a solemn oath, order, and a powerful technology. They used their understanding of magic to make talismans that could protect them from the wild magic storms that had taken over Mana Ulla. Intending to return shortly, they honed their fighting skills both with and without the talisman, in case the talismans failed or broke. They knew the power of these talismans and how it could mean the end of the Manarahi so they worked in secret and trained specially groomed prodigies to //only// make these talismans and to only make them a certain way. When Mana Ulla was completely evacuated in 2081, They stayed in Drakenhearth until 2323, when it was decided that they would rejoin with their fellow Manarahi and protect them with their arts. They crossed the dragon coast and presented themselves to the then war-mage Naranoru Mikao. The war mage saw their anti-magic talismans as bordering on blasphemy and insulting to Manarahi culture. The idea of someone cutting themselves off so completely from magic for any reason was unthinkable to him. Some "Brazen and Mad" Trussari then submitted a request for diplomacy in triplicate directly to one of the lawyers they cornered in a bar (some accounts claim it was the Xanaran's). When the court of the king was presented with the request, a furious 2333 year-old Tarn Ravora Challenged the war mage to a Wizard's duel. During the duel, Tarn Teleported his opponent next to (and above) one of the Trussari who were watching and then began throwing rocks at the war mage. With no magic armor and no training against normal rocks, the war mage was mostly unable to do anything. When Naranoru tried to leave, he found himself trapped inside of the spell Forcecage, centered on the trussari.  As Tarn Ravora himself recounts:
	//The look on Naranoru's face was the sheer essence of the opposite of what was on that tarparmishi's. Trapped in an antimagic field, getting rocks thrown at you through the bars of a spell just a hair's breadth bigger than that field, and the one person who could free him was one of the people he told to leave Manaharamu. And that boy, the Trussari, Grinning ear-to ear as the war mage tried to move him from where he stood so he could break out of the prison. I told everyone nearby to clear out and I started shuffling my magic around and Dropped one of them beads (//**Delayed blast fireball**)// right in front of the cage. Poured every single drop of magic I had into it.  I asked the boy if he was alright staying where he was and he said to me in this voice that was half a yell "I have no intention of leaving where I am" and then he shrugged this biiiiiig shrug, took a whole six seconds to do. //
	
	//Naranoru then turns to me and says this'll be over in a minute when the bead goes off and I stare him in the eye and say "Cheva, I'm terrible at keeping time, That spell's only a minute long?"  and he leers at me and  says "yes, Tarn, and then you'll die" "I am the worst mage in the world" I say, "I've gone and fouled it up and that bead's going to stick there for a year!" and the rapid change of colours on his face then! Never have I seen a face go from pink to bone white to nearly purple so quick. "You'll have to sleep sometime Tarn! Or this Filthy Taparmishi will have to leave!" And the Trussari, bless him, says "I have lived on a diet of dust since I was twelve and my only water has been my own sweat. I can stay in this cage until the stars blot out" and //**I** say "//If you can tell me a bedtime story that'd be swell, I haven't slept yet this year" And I threw another rock at Naranoru. Oh he pouted in that cage for a solid hour before the king came by to see how the duel was going, he hadn't heard from anyone yet. The king hated watching duels you see. So he comes down and sees me sitting on the edge of the stage having a grand old chat with another of the trussari (From a distance mind), and asks why the duel isn't up. And I point at the cage and the bead and said "Your war mage is being a coward and won't stop hiding behind that man there. The Trussari bows his head to the king and says "your majesty, have you heard the petition of the Trussari? We are Manarahi and wish to return to our family and heritage." //
	
	**Nirrum's note: At this point, Piralysraha Tarn Ravora, the one telling this tale, begins to laugh. A lot.**
	
	//And the KING. THE KING, HE SAYS "I would gladly have you and yours among my people if this is what you can do to one of my most powerful casters." <//**Laughter>**. AND POOR NARANORU SAYS //"King Mokempa! Tarn has put a civilian in danger and trapped me here while a dangerous spell is cast around us! This is dishonorable, this is against the law of the mage's duel!" and I <//**Tarn laughs for nearly a fully minute here and the next set of sentences take nearly all of his effort to get out>**//I SAYS TO HIM "WALK ON OUT YOU LOUT, NOTHING'S STOPPING YOU" AND HE GESTURES AT THE CAGE. THE KING LOOKS AT THE BEAD, LOOKS AT ME, LOOKS AT THE CAGE AND THEN BURIES HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS "YOU GOT TIME YOUR MAJESTY" I yell and //**<Tarn pauses for breath the next line is barely audible until the last few words> **//And the king walks up to him. He walks right up through the bars and asks the boy if he's uncomfortable, and the boy says "a little, this stone is too soft for me to lie down on, do you have any adamant I can sleep on" And the king says "we have some at the palace, come join me, I must find a new war mage, this one's an idiot. Tarn" he says to me "Tarn, I'm calling you the winner of this duel, drop the spell" and NARANORU is just staring at the king like he was a dragon and the king yells at him " YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON TWO THINGS AT ONCE JARAHA" //
	**Tarn, and indeed, the rest of the court erupt into laughter at this**
	//Aaaaany way he got demoted to Seargant and I would have got ten years in prison for reckless endangerment if the same Trussari boy didn't ask the court where the danger was, says he meant to stand right were he was so he could stand in the heat 'cause back home, they had to to stand in lava to get the grime and sweat off them 'cause they couldn't use prestidigitation and normal fire wasn't hot enough! AND THE COURT BELIEVED IT BECAUSE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAD EVER USED SOAP.//
	**More laughter, though it must be said that a few people are whispering to each other trying to figure out what soap is. **
	//So I got a year for dishonorable conduct in a duel and he got a month for contempt of court. Got a fine meal from the Trussari every day. Mokempa could never look me in the eye without crackin a smile after that.//

From that point on the Trussari were part of the Manaharamu military and guard. They were still outcasts and //Taparmishi// until the year of Darkness, where they were perhaps the biggest reason Manaharamu survived at all. Now the Trussari are an honored position. No parent wants their child to become one but when they walk out of the hall of the Trussari, wearing the talisman and uniform, you can bet that they'll never stop bragging about their child to their friends. They are rather fluid in the military, often using their armor and talisman to save people from death, regardless of orders. This one-man-army attitude combined with a deep sense of family and duty for their fellow soldiers makes them legends. 
	**Nirrum's Note: **//And the Kholirahi claim to be the ones who sacrifice themselves for the good of others! What a farce. The Trussari cut themselves off from their lifeblood and heritage to become soldiers without magic to protect people who couldn't do the same for them. They fight against Beholders, flail snails, and even the works of willful mages and demiliches who could sap the power from even me. They stand against the strongest Paladins and Clerics who both have measures against our great wizards. They stand in the paths of fire and fear so others can be shielded. Show me one dead-eyed druid who would run unblinking at an Astral Dreadnought and I'll show you Fifty Trussari in a race to do the same. I can cast a spell over any hall of the Manahararahi while standing next to one of these honored individuals. My verbal components are simply their introduction//

To be a Trussari, one must have immense discipline. One must be a talented warrior to begin with, be devoted with no reservations to the good of Manaharamu and the Manahararahi, and be ready to give your life entirely away to the training required to be one. Because of their antimagic talismans they face extreme austerity while within Manaharamu. Trussari who lose or remove their talismans must pay for the materials to get a new one, which is a considerable amount of money. Some older Trussari, in particular some elves, go on "Magical Vacations" having pre-paid for a new talisman. It is worth noting that Many of the trussari //are// still trained in the use of magic and inside their own hall may train their arts in a way that makes use of magic. Some trussari get //more dangerous in combat when their talismans are off.//

The trussari uniform consists of a pointed conical helmet with a noseguard inlaid with gold. Mail avontails are not uncommon. They wear wide-legged green pants that narrow into their boots which are usually greaves, and white shirts which have often been embroidered. (It is tradition for someone wishing to court or date a member of the Trussari to go to the looms and embroider a unique pattern, but more often than not this gets them embroiled within Aralc's fey politics). Most trussari wear their armor outside of their whites, making it easier to take off.



**5854:** **The Trussari have gone into hiding. They seek to destroy Kholira.**

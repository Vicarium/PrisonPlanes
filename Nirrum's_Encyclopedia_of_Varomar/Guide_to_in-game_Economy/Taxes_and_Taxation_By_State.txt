====== Taxes and Taxation By State ======
Created Monday 17 February 2020

==== Manaharamu ====
		* Buildings are taxed 1g per 3ft of perimeter measured at the widest part of the house and an additional 1s per 12ft story tall per year. No building can be higher than three stories excluding a basement or where permitted by government. No building may have a basement deeper than 14ft from the ground outside, which is subject to its own zoning laws. All residential buildings must have their perimeters marked by only 90 degrees angles, Euclidian angles only.
		* Landlording or renting buildings is forbidden in Manaharamu except by permit for Inns, Taverns, Lodges, and workhouses
		* Only Citizens of Manaharamu are allowed to own property within the city. One must live in Manaharamu for a year before being considered for citizenship (usually in one of the lodges). 
		* Housing in Manaharamu costs 20x the housing tax
		* Working and operating a business in Manaharamu entitles the state to 3% of all profits.
		* The state collects a 1g water and sewer tax per person yearly
				//Nirrum's note: //This is a source of contention among races who do not consume water or use sewers.
		* Electricity costs 3c per person per month flat rate in Manaharamu
		* All goods sold in Manaharamu are done so with an inclusive 5% sales tax
		* All trade caravans entering Manaharamu are subject to search and seizure if deemed necessary by law enforcement. 
			//Nirrum's Note: //Caravans are incentivized to allow and enable searches. If there's something that one of us school masters needs, well, we get paid a lot of money for our services and we live on school grounds and can conjure furniture out of the air, so we are known to //grossly// overpay for even the simplest item. The Gate guards run through a checklist of contraband as well as a list of items that are  items the mages are looking for. If they find something that we need, the Caravans are informed that, barring special court permissions, they can sell it for our dictated "budget price" or have it legally seized. The practice is ham-fisted but to avoid heirlooms, private business interests, or offspring being taken by the University, any challenge for court permission gets to happen //before// seizure. These permissions are usually granted. I once paid Twenty thousand gold for a "French-english (common) dictionary". Because of this, I know one of the secrets of Grand Tortuga
		* Buildings that are unoccupied for more than 2 years are considered abandoned and are reposessed by the state
		* Satellite states are expected to deliver 10% of their annual income to Manaharamu's Trade commission. Each Satellite is entitled to reductions on this rate proportionate to assessed value. 
				//Nirrum's Note: //Shaat Dar enjoys a tax rate that is lower than living in the city in exchange for their seafood harvesting, Military value and contribution, Strategc positioning, and their region being the preferred location for the circle of the coast program, among other factors
		* Satellite states must have their taxation plan ratified by the Manaharamu Trade Commission in public court yearly.

==== Skalmirthon City ====
	* All buildings are property of the government and for which permits are constitutionally granted to those apply. Permits are automatically granted preferrentially to the Constructor of the building, the occupants of that building, and the species the building was intended for on construction, but can be challenged quarterly. Permits can be invalidated by the state in the event of an unpaid debt to society, permanent death, or as deemed necessary by the Court and Crown for the development of the city. Permits that are invalidated can be re-instated within 1 month of notice by payment of the debt plus a fee, or through court process.
	* Permits to occupy an unoccupied structure or tenement within a structure can be applied for with 5cp, a written (or dictated) letter of intent, and a citizenship status form (1cp per copy made.
	* Goods sold in Skalmirthon city are subject to a 10% inclusive sales tax
	* Businesses in Skalmirthon are assessed to comply with tax laws, paying in Percentage of income stated to the crown.
		* 1% for water and sewer
		* 10/n% per worker, where n is the number of workers who file their own taxes and claim a business as their place of employment
		* .5% per Mj electricity used (best paid monthly)
		* An Industry tax (done by quarter)
	* Citizens are required to pay a flat rate of 4% wage tax above the age of Majority. The Crown offers rebates to legally disabled or injured folk and penalties for the illegally unemployed.
		//Nirrum's Note:// Skalmirthon has take up Manaharamu's Rehabilitation programs to allieviate their crowded prisons. This lapsed between Monarchs but was re-instated with //gusto// with the Reign of **King Deloch Welch**. This means that people with disabilities or difficulties that are not legally recognized aren't getting irreparably ousted from the work force and society.
	* By Tradition, the Monarch pays their taxes in the middle of the tax cycle. As the national accounts are by extension their own, this means that citizens of Skalmirthon recieve a tax-relief rebate at this time, which is usually a few gold.
	* The Dwarven Lelumadil Tribal Administrative Hierarchy, represented by the mayor, performs the taxes of (mostly) dwarves who live within the exclusive commune. The profits of the commune are direct property of the crown, but in recognizing that there are goods and services that one cannot obtain within the commune, all dwarves are entitled to a yearly allowance equivalent to 20% of their average productivity that year. In Exchange for the rest, their needs are universally looked after to the best of the Crown's ability, on pain of death, haunting, and revolution should the crown fail to uphold this part of the bargain. Purchases that are not available within skalmirthon are to be submitted to the city broker. A member of the commune must live within skalmirthon's administrative regions and work for the majority of the year. These citizens, representing no established business, obtaining any personal profits, and working as employees of Skalmirthon and for the betterment of its people pay no other taxes.
	* Foreign businesses may operate within skalmirthon at the leave of the reigning Monarch
	* Satellite states are required to pay A tax equivalent to their assessed economy to the Auditor represenative of the Monarch, which is not infrequently the Monarch themselves. The tax is a approximation of 4% of their gross estimated income for the following year +100g. The monarch and consultants might raise this rate for cases of stagnation or lower it in cases of growth. Taxation of the constituents of Satellite states is up to the government of that state, provided it is approved by the Monarch (which it always has been)
	* Satellite taxes can be paid in the form of special goods or services which are offered for sale at discounted rates to the citizens of Skalmirthon equalling the value of the tax. In the case of goods, half of what is given brought in  in total as well  anything left over after the other citizens have bought what they wanted is then given to the commune to use. In the case of services, the commune can benefit from these services first, and they are then offered to the citizens at a discounted rate.
	//Nirrum's note:// Skalmirthon was a democracy for the past hundred and ten years. Unfortunately the democracy was set up by those who did not have its best interests in mind, causing collapse and unrest. Many of these laws are revivals of old laws and have been modified since **5852** under the reign of the new King.  MnPrlr. Deloch Welch is a **Manaharamu **native

	* Approval to purchase property in a city must be sought from parliment. Only Citizens are allowed to purchase property within the city limits but in the surrounding lands of the suzzerain, anyone can apply.

	* Ranked Maze-hunters are able to claim their donations to the maze hunters as taxes paid. The Hall of the maze hunters spends a portion of these donations every year to donate to the poor and to prop up local businesses
		* **As of 5854 this focuses particularly hard on the new identification industry**
	* The schools of Danzuishan are not required to pay tax
	* A tariff on Magical items of 10% of the item's cost is applied to any business that imports magical items.
	* A tariff on mundane goods is applied at 5% of the item's cost past a lower limit of 1 gold.
	* The monarch and the suzerain have eminent domain and can seize any property they wish, though they have not acted on this in a very long time.
	* There is no tax for people living within the suzzerain's lands provided they do not run a business, but a yearly tithe of some value is expected on pain of dragonbolts and wrath of Zorquan.

==== Kara'ite ====

	* Those who do not work together to benefit Kholira will be arrested and put to work for the benefit of Kholira

==== Konia (Morwerta) ====
	//Nirrum's Note: //I am struggling to understand Konian Tax law, especially now after the war of ants, where many of the offices referred to in the tax law are quite visibly ruins. All the people seem to know is that a tax collector shows up about once a month, takes a few gold, and leaves. Occasionally bards show up wearing Noble's colours put on a play and on occasion someone gets paid to fix the roads. My hikaorahi and students have been studying this for  three years now and **if anyone manages to find any of the ledgers, I would be willing to pay for them**
	
	The Satellite states all seem to have their own communal coffer and robust democratic councils except **Morwerta, and Cermina. **Morwerta seems to be where the taxes are going for the most part and Cermina seems to have a dictator under the name "Raido 'Spidereater' Lomak"

**Incomplete section.**

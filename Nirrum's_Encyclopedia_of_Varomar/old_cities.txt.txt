 Mokoi Tha'am 
	Githzerai, Hengeyokai, Elves. All excellent hunters in this jungle town. The town is built in the trees, not to avoid the dangerous beasts that roam the forest floor (there are many in the canopy) but to avoid the seasonal flooding and occasional mudslide. The town specializes in gathering exotic fruit and spices, like peppers, pineapple, saffron and cinnamon. Screens are a Necessity, as many spiders, snakes, and angry tree-dwelling mammals (and stuff) dwell in the mazelike canopy. Some Solar collectors have been installed directly above the town. They are shielded and covered to prevent damage.

 Bladewater 
	A human Whaling settlement on the cold northern shore. Permanent tents of fur and leather maintain heat fairly well on the cold shore. Freshwater is usually gleaned from the snow, because despite fishing for Kraken, Leviathan, Whale and well...fish... The viking-esque inhabitants aren't stupid enough to go near the river for which the settlement gets its name. Vegetables are often shipped into the town via road or boat. Only one building has power and that's the solar powered Longhouse, which houses the chieftain, most people who don't want to spend the night in their tent (or are too drunk), the operations headquarters, and the dining hall and kitchens. The meat is stored underground in the locker. Has a clan and sept system, the clans are different villages unified in war. The clans are warrior groups following different schools of warfare, training together for years before returning to their septs. The clans are encouraged by the Khalidorians to wage war amongst themselves to ensure only the strong and battle hardened survive.

Ardeo
A wizard’s Respite on the dry west coast, this isn’t a town so much as it is the eccentricity of a few mages with a small number of people mad enough to stay. There, the residents boast a finer understanding of planar sciences than the University of Manaharamu, which is bogged down with politics

	
CITIES

 Skalmirthon
	The Dwarven-Drow-Sverfneblin underground city of really really great mining. Although Technically the city isn't underground as it sits in the Caldera of the great Skal Volcano, it never receives any weather other than "sunny" as the peak sits higher than any cloud can reach, short of rare cirrus wisps off the top. The city is powered by Deep thermal power, water is tapped from the springs inside the mountain walls, Food is often imported in exchange for the variety of crafts, mechanisms, machinery and raw materials extracted from the nearby mines, which tap into the volcano's rich ores.

	The city is host to great night life, and sports a variety of exotic drug trade, and a great many illegal activities to boot. Also fight pits. FIIIIIGHT PIITTSSSS. Plumbing mostly runs into a pit of Lava about three miles out, Vented in another crater well enough removed from the town that in the event of eruption, the town would be safe. Recently the town has gained a new King after the previous republic failed, He has left a Regent in charge in his stead.
	
Kholira

	Friendly people, beautiful women, sprawling farms and enchanted fields of crops, wonderful artisanry and a Definitive and passionate pursuit of the complete Submission of the rest of the world. Their Godking is said to have been inspired by a book that fell from the duel of two angels as they flashed between worlds. Lots of Flowers	
	
Manaharamu
	The technological capital of the continent, Manaharamu boasts the finest educational standards and a good place to get out of the rain. Nearby a large Aether collection power plant and distribution center beams energy to the other cities. Most Cities have their own backup power but the teslaharmonic radiation synthesizer horns give them what it takes to truly power their civilization. Manaharamu boasts some exotic foods, despite being in the deep desert, and LOTS of enchanting and magical services and opportunities to expand one's skills. Underneath Manaharamu are the ancient Koldathi Catacombs, and under them, a series of deep caves. Manaharamu's government is run by a moderately successful constitutional monarchy, though trouble has occured in recent years with the Current Queen insulting the Kholidorian Godking. Power is obtained through the power plant and the solar panel fields nearby. Water is obtained through mountain springs. Sewage water is often recycled, and waste is often sent to the university botanical gardens and arbotoreum where many rare species of plant live. Manaharamu's main products are Oils from local plants, Medicine, and knowledge, which has proven to be more than enough to keep the country rich and well fed. 

Konia
	A Hexagonal fortification girds a degagramal series of ramparts and artillery. Konia is a large castle citadel with strict security. Konia has a failing economy due to it's spending on weapons in the last war, all of which were made obsolete by Manaharamu's Aircraft. Sections of the city have been cordoned off to prevent the spreading of several plagues. Many predatorial races that are...less inclined to coexist with any sort of society in mind have come to feed or experiment on the people of the town...regardless of their mortal status. The current government, an army of Paladins, Clerics, and Invokers of a variety of good gods, have recently overthrown the previous despotic tyrant in place of a senate, formed by the head of each of these orders. Some mild political strife from religion has caused progress to be slow. The town is rife with history, but that may not always be a good thing. The oldest building in town is a massive (town-sized) Cathedral, ornate, covered in gargoyles, and claiming nothing toward any god, people rarely venture within. Outside the city are the ruins of old fortifications from wars fought, they are said to be haunted, and they are. The town sustains itself though, despite the hardships, on game from the haunted forest which has turned out both a multitude of corpses and incredibly skilled hunters, on its art and scupltures, and it's mass production of fine cloths, leathers, and still yet, arms.
	
Dwallat
	The Anarchic Kingdom of Dwallat is a Dystopic clusterfuck of sin, violence, and offence. "Ruled" over by a family of Teiflings, the vast underground expanse was pilfered from the dwarves by assaulting creatures of the darkness in the deep 
	caves that riddle the Plateau in which they they had the misfortune to build in. Everything dislikable and Rotten seems to have gathered here in a pit of barbarism and hermitism. A lot of dragons have their hoards here, and a lot of people have died trying to get to them. Most of them not all the way dead either. Wild things inhabit the tunnels and sandy crags as well. Gricks and Liondrakes stalk prey here, and are often preyed upon by The Various Sphinxes that also guard treasure here. The city is unpowered but the dwarves were rumoured to be working on something in the deep before they were slaughtered. It is the ideal place to go if you want to be left to your own devices though, The Porous but strong rock filters out all noise, and easily disguised doors may house decent folk that had no where else to go. The Lord of the Dragons' Name is Ujira.

Kara'ite
	LOREM IPSUM DOLORE SIT AMET

Danzuishan
	Smaller than the other cities by area but no less grand, The River city of Danzuishan is populated largely by Half-elves, Humans, and Even a few Deva have been known to live in the higher lofts.  Surrounded by large natural arches of some magical quality, Danzuishan has called itself the “ribbed city.” The city operates in an inducted council. As one of the major locks for the River of Many Names, it is a fairly large source of trade, dealing in goods from all around the river’s many small towns, including local goods such as cormorant, aquatic magical reagents, copper, and marble. They get their power from many subtle generators at the side of the locks
The town sees a yearly influx of river serpents, and opens the locks wide for them. Other than those serpents and their deadly poison, the town is rather safe. Danzuishan’s emblem is a golden phoenix, rumoured to live in the canyons around. The tallest pillar of Danzuishan, the Qinhai Tower, reaches high into the sky, and is topped by a house where an ancient bell can occasionally be heard.

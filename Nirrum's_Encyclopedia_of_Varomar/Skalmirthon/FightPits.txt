====== FightPits ======
Created Wednesday 17 January 2018


One way or another your Players are likely to end up in the fight pits, whether that's voluntarily or as a result of commiting a crime. This is actually a really good time to pit the party against itself. 
The Fight pits consist of Bleachers with vomitoriums, food stands, bookies, and the pit itself. 
The pit itself is a 70ft wide platform surrounded by a 10ft wide actual pit that is 30ft deep and lined with spikes. At the edge of the pit is an extremely tall chain link fence as well as the drawbridge-entrance to the  arena from the Dungeon and "locker rooms."


The pits encompass a series of encounters ranging from "brutal" to "Dramatic" and by that I mean from People to Monsters.

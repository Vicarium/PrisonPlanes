		Imgi Gigralo INTP
			A Human chemist from the university of Manaharamu. He's the one who figured out the secret of Galvanized rubber. Before then the fugin had been barely holding onto their place in Grand tortuga. He is 66 and a veteran of the Manaharamu-Konia war. He has dark skin, a scar over his right eye and white straight hair. His voice is scratchy and deep.
			
		
		Raker Newgrad ESFP
			A Rugged square of an Elf, and a bombastic party animal. He wears Dragonscale armor constantly. He always tries to solve his problems nonviolently but trouble seems to follow him. He is a warlock with the pact of the hexblade and he is bound to a quarterstaff (that functions as a greatsword because why not) which demands the right to defend him from physical harm. The Fugin use him in negotiations, knowing that he'll say the right thing and if shit hits the fan, people are going to end up losing their souls. 
			
	Fugin Compound (1)
		Built into a wall high north. It is a warded dungeon that remains empty for most of the day. The fugin use it as a stronghold but not for much.

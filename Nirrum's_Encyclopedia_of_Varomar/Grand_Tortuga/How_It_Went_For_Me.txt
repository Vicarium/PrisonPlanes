====== How_It_Went_For_Me ======
Created Thursday 07 June 2018


Vignette
	The calls of gulls fill the air. You are all, for a moment, Dock workers.  You work on the eastport dock Of Grand Tortuga, the largest safe haven for Free Villainy on the plane. It smells a little funky, and the water is not water you want to swim in, as the sewage outlet is nearby. Describe yourselves briefly... Perception checks. Suddenly, a call Echoes out from the jungle. Dragons, large and small begin to crowd the sky, most of them green or black. They fly over the island, rushing, racing to...something.... or from something. One of them attacks another in the air above you, and the assailed dragon falls, and lands on your dock. The Stormpiercers are all being pointed up at the greater threats, no one seems to have noticed that A young blue dragon has crashed down already. But it has noticed you. 
Notes
	The players are all "Veterans" that have no weapons on hand other than dagger each. Around the dock though, there are better weapons, Including  boom hooks (halberd, piercing damage), Harpoons(Trident, but 1d8 Thrown) , Mauls, Boarding Axes (battle axes). They face a young blue dragon that has already had 50 damage done to it. After a few turns the dragon gets blown away by the beam of a storm piercer but coming from the east of the cove. There, rounding the point are two ships, covered in large bones, black paint, and red sails.
	
Intro
	The call of gulls fills the air as you approach port, quite distinctly *not*(pause for effect) several people fighting a young blue dragon but a different set of people having just blown one away with your fore-mounted stormpiercer. You are, as you know, the crew of the "Hell and High Water"  and her compatriot Ship "The Bloody Sister," both black with red sails, both covered in large bones and other unfortunates. Both Sailing underneath a red flag embroidered with a Black Cockatrice, the Colors Adopted by Captain Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux, and raised first by a group known in hushed whispers as "The red mist" An enemy to the Konian Military, Escaped Kholirahi Slaves, Raiders of Dwarven Tombs, Plunderers of mines, and, if rumors are true, madfolk who sailed clean through Ganglegrove, and who Conquered the Tepet Ruins. You are, all, greeted with the sight of a large Conical Island, Framed against wispy clouds in the morning blue sky. The island is almost entirely covered with houses and buildings, stacked into the rock with little room between them, save where Zig-zag roads run up, and ring roads run round. From your angle, two wide docks are visible, The smaller, closer wharf where you dispatched the unfortunate Scaleback, and the larger, more southern wharf.  This, is Grand tortuga, Many of you have heard it is the largest safe haven for Free Villainy on the plane. As the dragons pass and the sky clears, a couple of stormpiercers focus on you, but they do not fire. The town seems to relax as you draw near. I, an observer fear, that relief is ill-placed. Begin. 
	


==== What I Expected ====
THE PLOT 

DUN DUN DUN

The Changeling cult has determined that the "dead man's Chest" þat sits in the Council Chambers in the Caldera of Grand Tortuga is actually a pun, and is one of the Bones. Only the Avisen know this, as it was originally their treasure. Shami Murtuck, one of the more powerful changelings, had Valtu Jaquy killed by another changeling (Meng Shi) who was rather high in the Decidente crew, and had him frame the Kveter-Klas' prodigy, Willy. While the Jaquy prepare to Extract revenge from the Kveter-Klas, the Avisen and Stockwood are both preparing for war, unchecked by their greatest enemy. Everything goes to shit from there. 

Upon Touching the shore of Grand tortuga, Thymae senses the presence of a bone somewhere on the island.

The Encounterparty are docked in westport as well, Led by by either Tulio, Bullji, or Derrek, depending on who you ask. They're doing merc work for multiple factions. They try to pin their crimes on Tibeaux's Crew

While eating, Fugin enforcers enter the establishment and attack.

If Questioned the Fugin Accuse The Red Mist Pirates of the Murder of Hetrid Mace, One of the Fugin's recruits. They claim that there are witnesses who saw Tibeaux and Cosades Perform the act. The 13 year old has been clubbed to death just inside the North east tunnel to Remesari Circus. 
The Fugin Crew are on high alert for Tibeaux and number approximately 1 in 12 out of people on the street, Someone might be seen running away if they spot any of the noteworthy members of the crew, Assume trouble will follow if you stick around 

The fugin are less active at night, 1 in 50, but the Avisen, Stockwoods, Furi, and Bal'Jasar are 1 in 10, Killing any of these will . The major Exception to this is Aik'No Fugin, who, with a small, elite escort can be found and the French Dragon just after sundown. 

Shortly Thereafter, the Highwater's Treasury is robbed. Witnesses say that Giþ did it, Five of the Crew are Dead, their throats cut and Eyes gouged out. A hard investigation check reveals that there is a bite mark on one of the crew.


The Crew gets hunted and harassed until they stumble upon a man getting beat up in an alley by some thugs (Egbarnes, sent by Furi). He gets killed in one swoop. When he dies, he reverts to his true form, A boneless changeling. *DRAMABUTTON.COM*  The changeling bears the insignia of the MacLeodquin. an investigation check of 15 or higher finds a letter from Ghuivere DurFisher Asking about the investigation into the Stockwood activity in The Works. You also find 1g tucked in his belt.

A Charisma Check of 10 on just about anyone can tell you where to find  The Works, there are enterances In the Underport, Remesari circus, or at the power plants near the underport or Eastport. 


The MacLeodquin report no Missing members if asked about the man's Death, They will point to the DurFisher, the local thieves as a likely explanation. 

(the route diverges briefly, as the DurFisher will point them to the pipeworks on completing a quest to destroy a ship in the harbor in Souþport. This triggers malevolance from the Hatain(fugin now), causing the Random encounter roll to be roughly 50/50.) The DurFisher Offer Information that they know the party Needs, They point toward one Meng Shi, a Decidente, A changeling, and the cause of much strife against the Murtuck family. It is clear he is trying to stir up trouble with them. Meng shi is a hard man to find, but is often seen in the company of Murky, the Stillmaster.

The Works are a steamy, thick and smelly set of tunnels that can barely fit a person most of the time. On occasion, there'll be a junction where there's a bit of room, or a maintenance shaft. Large Creatures cannot fit in here. Moving through other Creature's spaces is difficult terrain. It is pitch black. 
After a while wandering around the works, They find A Large room covered in pipes, wires, and small red lights. The room is well lit.  
"Marvelous, isn't it" Exclaims Guy DeFer. He explains that this is the most important room for troubleshooting the works. The Stockwoods use the Works for getting around because they're able to access the ducts. They help things along. He explains his sister knows this and just wants excuses for her People the DurFisher, to come down and harass him. He used to be one of them, Until his mother died. If questioned about the Changelings, He beckons them to follow him down a long and winding set of corridors. Somewhere under norþport, he tells them that If you want to find out about the cult of the changelings, to look closer at the ties of alliances. They're trying to keep their head down. The DurFisher's Information can always be bought in coin.


It is at this point that the Kveter-Klas make themselves Known to the party and offer to take off some of the heat if they join up. The Barry and Rockwallers do the same almost simultaneously. They all quickly run away as Slovenka Bruchev floats nearby. She offers the party Tea at her Crew's House. 

If they accept, she leads them to high southeast. Her eyes are remarkably unclouded by time. She speaks with them and is brief. She has been alive for 122 years and is getting a little sick of all this fighting. She has been personal friends with the stockwood's cabin since she was a young 16. She has been at odds with Luciaria Avisen since she was 8. She sees in Tibeaux the same light as her Father, who pushed his way into the politics of this island fifty years after each family was already entrenched. She offers the full support of the Bruchev Crew (and does so in the prese0

Ch2 is marked by the progression into war among the factions and the movement of the Changelings


The Bruchev crew now have a 1/12 chance of joining battle in the daytime with 1d4 extra members

Trying to investigate the decidente causes Meng Shi to run. He transforms freely as he attempts to make it to northport
Meng Shi is an Identical build to Cosades.

With Meng Shi out of the way, relationships between the murtuck and the decidente heal.

AND THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkD0MxNY_Bw

Things that didn't happen

The Council holds another meeting the next day. Slovenka asks Tibeaux and Krelthar to stand at her side during the talks. There, all of the Pirate Fleet Admirals are gathered and introduced. No one starts until everyone is present. The Decidente are the last to show up. Marco Decidente looks particularly sour. Slovenka Remarks that he always looks like that. Shami Murtuck (Hero voice) looks visibly delighted and starts the meeting by motioning to a cart that his crew brings in behind him, inside are the corpses of eight changelings.



"I've had to purge my own crew with this news." He looks at Tibeaux "You have my thanks captain, This corruption has seeped deeper than any of us would have known"


prep trumpets
A very tall half-orc woman(drippy, Light becomes leuckt, really hard consonants) glares at tibeaux "it is more likely he is the one who brought them here, I say we (TRUMPETS)" she cuts off as Ghuivere DurFisher's trumpet breaks out in the middle of her talking. She tries to talk, but is interrupted each time by a trumpet burst until A short, white-haired woman with large breasts in a green, black and purple corset, speaks up.  

If the Avisen are enemies of the players at this point, she stares down Tibeaux with hunger. "these, wax-babies have been here for a long time, but I would not think these people are not complicit"

If the Avisen are not enemies "These wax-babies have been here a long time. These new faces might be complicit but this cult has been around far longer than any of the rest of you"
At this, slovenka lets out a quiet cough whereupon Luciaria says, "Except you and I, hag, how are you even still alive?"
Slovenka remarks "I start my day off with a drink of holy water. It's highly alcoholic"

"So who *DO we point our fingers at?" Asks Marco Decidente 

The table errupts into argument. An aide Passes Tibeaux a note from Shami Murtuck, offering a fresh alliance. 

The city erupts into war, the first day, the Macleodquin attack the Decidente, Simultaneously, the DurFisher raid the Barry Compound in a move to retrieve their hostages and To block aid to the Macleodquin. At Night the avisen Attack the Decidente to aid the Macleodquin but the Decidente are there waiting. The Barry Retaliate against the DurFisher by Teaming up with the Bal'Jasar to attack the DurFisher ships. 

Slovenka, who meets up with the party at some point seems younger than she was, far younger, looking just out of her prime. She hands a Letter to Tibeaux. It describes How Orsithach Furi caused the death of his father. She then hands him another letter that refers to her as "Babushka Bruchev" and is signed by Lazarus' Father "jean-baptiste arno sebastien tibeaux II", wiþ a Tear stained invitation to a wedding that matches Tibeaux's. "You can't show weakness until it's a strength" Wiþout anoþer word, She flies off Norþ. 



þe rest of þe adventure focuses around the disintegration of the Pirate clans. Most independant crews leave as soon as fighting breaks out.
The General Order follows 
1) The vying for power of the pirate crews. This is entirely in the Player's hands.
	Just follow the chart and see who's got the most allies and the least leverage.
2) The Use of the Largest Weapons. Desperate bigwigs will use their trump cards.
	
		
	
4) The emergence of the cult as a force to fight against. 
		When the crews are minimized and it looks like  there's going to be a power grab, the Changelings make it first. The Murtucks Strike. Everyone in the Council chamber gets backstabbed, literally, and most of them killed. The changelings take the next day trying to get access to the chest, which sits in a pit in the middle of the floor, covered in magical glass and warded against all manner of spell. When in trouble they summon  Combartch Tc'tcaeri, the wizard who grants them an item which constantly spews fire while uncapped to melt the glass.
		
		The Chest contains, of course, a large ribcage and collarbone which can be worn as armor. The armor regenerates the wearer's hit points by 15 per round, except on machines or undead. The Wearer Cannot go unconcious, lose arms, and is immune to poison and disease.
		
		The cult attempts to abscond with the artifact unless stopped, then they get *hostile*
		
5) Two goals 
		The Construction of an airship hinges on Danzuishanese tech. But Tibeaux now has a name for his Father's killer. Orsithach Furi, Patron of the Furi Clan, the most powerful criminal on the plane. There is a secret Tunnel that carries a train all the way to dwallat. 
		
		

==== What I got ====

**Not all of these are in order, but let's be honest, you can catch how this went down**


	
Interactions in GT
	
Cosades and thymae have a "changeling"(not a changeling) in captivity Deal with this first.
	It Laughs at them for a bit, maybe taunts them, then Suddenly, it is a non-native drow who is very upset about being out in the sun. By necessity, the drow are Nocturnal. If they manage to get an arcana check off, they might be able to sense the arcane effects of "Dominate Person"
	
	It is possible that the creature controlling this drow is smarter and won't give up any information including not taunting and will release hold of the drow as soon as it is captured.

Tibeaux and Krelthar have asked the avisen to show up at evening.
The Avisen Show up, accompanied by a horde of bats.  Five stay at the edge of the dock, Two come up to the gangplank. Four of the five are tall, Dressed in Black and Purple. Each one carries Both a Rod and a Slender sharp sword (Imperial Napoleonic Horse Grenadier sabre), The one in the middle has curled silver hair and is over a foot shorter than the tallest of her compatriots. She Holds a Gold parasol.
	The Avisen Representitive, Malachi Hraoger  is a full-fledged Vampire, as is his Companion Quercannon
		

	Malachi has a Tenser's Floating disc following him and he uses as a chair near the gangplank. Quercannon wanders around in the background inspecting parts of the ship slowly, occasionally turning to say something.
	
		"You wished to speak with us about an attack on your ship?" m
		"Habeus Corpus?" m "Do you... HAVE the BODY"
		"That person definitely looks like they still have all their blood." m
		
		"The Gith attack and you find a vampire bite, and you can't think of any creature that can and would be both" q
		"You've already told the Fugin there were changelings on the island. Why would you suspect us first when you've already been targeted? And for that Matter why not suspect the more likely Gith Vampire, travelling with other gith? We are not responsible for every fledgeling that calls themselves a pirate."q
		
		"Come on Malachi, This was a waste of time"q
		"It will have been if we don't come out of it with something."m
		
		"We want your co-operation in the events of the next few days, days which we are sure will be exciting"m
		"Malachi, These people are nothing compared to our own, Why do we entertain the notion that they'd be even slightly useful"q
		
		"They already have been useful Quercannon, as yourself has pointed out. TIBEAUX, In exchange for overlooking this slight, The lady avisen wishes for a treat of non-aggression against the avisen for the next fourteen days and nights. You have assaulted two of our members and impeded the business of one other, then brought false accusations to bear against us."m
		
		
	The Attempted Recruitment of Zog Earthshaka into the cult by Tulio Thomas. 
		After zog's encounter with the Wesport Angels, He is greeted by a slender, blonde-and-white haired sailor with a thick mustache. his bangs are cut short and coifed back and the rest of his long hair tied in a small blue bow. He is thin and looks unnaturally tall, despite being only 5'11, owing to his well-tailored blue pants and orange dress shirt on top of which wears a brown vest and a Magenta Cravat. At his hip is a backward Curved sabre, tucked into a magenta sash to match his Cravat. He talks with a thick acadian accent
			"ell-o frenduh, I likeh thatt trick with the chair. Not many are confident enufff to approach dah westpordAngels, Care to join me for a midday meal Frenduh? My Treat, What's your name by the way?"
			"Oooh, Eartdshaka, Orcs from anodder plane. yeah? I've met a few in my travels. The name is Tulio, Tulio Thomas. I've got proposition for you. How's Turtle Poutine an Immortality sound eh?"
			THEY HEAD TO THE BLACK BAL (oh hey, that worked)
		

**They blabbed about attacking the Jaquy in public. The Durfisher stopped trying**


TIBEAUX poisoned by Hatain member who was talking to Vyi Vyo - worker at berthold's body shop -- changeling
Hatain have coerced Red Mist.

Nazloe Hatain has Personally threatened Tibeaux

DurFisher have blackmail on the red mist about their plots against the Jaquy, are aware of their upgrading armament THIS ENDED HILARIOUSLY, TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T BLACKMAIL BLABBERMOUTHS


		
The DurFisher "negotiation" WELL THAT SHIT DIDN'T HAPPEN
		The DurFisher pre-emptively show up with a black envelope Asking that they show up at the "lobby"
		Blackmail can be paid off in gold, or services rendered
		
		Mixington- "Sure, this is the first time any of the Jaquy have ever died in the two thousand year history of Grand Tortuga, this is entirely a devastating blow to them and there's no way they can recover. And There's certainly no reason the DurFisher would ever want to ally with their longest running enemy now that the person with the highest scruples is dead. You guys definitely are in a position of power, what, coming to an island where you are largely foreign with no advantages, no clout, and a captain who sits on the shoulder of a red-skinned washup."
		"Really though, the only people who are worse off are the Kveter-Klas, who -supppppooosedly- started this whole clusterfuck. So are we going to get our way or are we going to get our way?" 
		


THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. Instead, the party got themselves into the colville screw... IN THE JAQUY COMPOUND. GENIUS. They destroyed all 22 of the munchkins
	Drug Thymae. Little old lady that sells cupcakes that double your speed, something like that. Rhohypnol

	The party wakes up to the ship on fire. A contingent of 10 sailors, 4 ratcatchers, 4 locks, 2 enforcers and Memory Jaquy himself. The Sister has been set adrift with its watchmen knocked out. The hatches downward are sealed and the cables on the ballistae have been Unstrung. Tibeaux's Sword and Cape are Missing, as are all weapons.
	
	"Combat" begins
	
	When combat ends and the Jaquy are x.X++**invariably**++X.x victorious, Memory Begins Smashing Tibeaux's face into the deck, only to heal him when he's about to die, then repeat. After a few minutes of this, Memory Jaquy stops for a moment, "Here is how your life works from now, until you stop being useful. MELIARCH"
	
	A humanoid with skin that seems to reflect a starry sky, even though it is cloudy, walks onto the deck. He Casts multiple spells. Everyone rolls a lot of wisdom saves, long story short, everyone is put under the effects of geas.
	
	"Obey the Jaquy, Serve the Jaquy, Do not resist our spells. Find out who killed Valtu Jaquy"
	
	The ship's flag is taken down and replaced with the Jaquy flag, A white quill and saltire bones on sable and blue chequy field
	
	"And stay away from my sister."
	
	Run the works from here
	
Things that actually happened.
	after escaping the jaquy compound via  Teleportation circle, they came *back*. They rounded the south end at the same time the Bruchev had finished their formation around the Destroyed compound. The Bruchev offered a one-shot deal. If the Red Mist could kill Memory Jaquy *now* they would be help them as opposed to kill them right now. Slovenka honors this, *only* because she is Tibeaux's Great-grandmother.
	
	
**Slovenka Bruchev ended up with the party's items, the party had defended themselves long enough to set up a teleportation circle back to their ship and used a scroll of meteor storm on the way out. Smuntsu sinfulnumber ended up not joining the fight because the party payed him off. Willy Klas lost and arm but Memory made it out unscathed (on two crits)**

Slovenka hands back the Party's goods when they get back aboard their ship. Evysirn has already begun sailing the ships to westport. 

	Slovenka Bruchev talks politics over tea
		"What is your plan now, Lazarus"
		"Who else will you ally with?"
		
		On each ship
			Fugin 
				The Fugin are good. Aik'no comes from the north, a ship coated in their black rubber can take quite a hefty hit and will never leak. My Contact in Danzuishan pays a lot for their product. 
			Rockwallers
				Those Shrews. They will likely not be happy with you. The Devil of the Jaquy was instrumental in helping them. As it was for me
			Decidente
				Be warned, while you are friendly with them, They are allied with the DurFisher. Old Ilmare Tenteeth Had just died when my father Took this very house for his own. Marco is a sour and bitter man. He grew up an orphan and took his clan back from the treacherous swine that killed his father himself. He is far more cunning than most give him credit for.
			Keter-Klas
				Eoff Kveter is no doubt indebted to you, provided Willy Klas didn't die in the explosive hellfire you brought down on the Jaquy. They won't offer recompense for your trouble but are likely to be pliable.
			Murtuck
				Shami is a nice boy. He's a scoundrel like the rest of us but they're the only crew that's gotten by on talk and blackmail. He's clever and friendly. That said, They're exceptionally good at the blackmail
			Avisen
				(She spits on the ground). Luciaria was a spoiled brat to begin with, then she made her pact when she killed her father. Don't go too close to her, Lazarus, She sees us all as cattle.
			Barry
				The Barry are strange folk. I don't even think they realize there's treasure in the hall, they're here for traditional plunder. I warn you though. They harbor a very, VERY dangerous monster. No mage can combat it. It appears as mouths in the ground, on tables, on decks, on roofs. I cannot describe it, but I hope you never encounter it.
			Furi
				(She loses her composure for a moment)
				<In Draconic> 
				<by Melora's effervescent period if you mention an alliance with them I will use every single spell and ally I have to roast the flesh off of your crew so fast you-> 
				No. You would do well to hate the Furi. Lagarach is a pleasant enough person when he's not around. They are the worst scum on this island and that says a lot.
			DurFisher
				If you (to cosades) could marry Ghuivere, do so. She is the richest person on the big turtle, but she's also one of the most irritating. Being in an alliance with the DurFisher doesn't mean they won't steal from you. It means that they'll give back the important things.
			Stockwood.
				If old Captain Jack is open for an alliance he doesn't show it. The Barry and Fugin got in when Admiral Stockwood was still... hanging around. They are powerful allies, but they are old pirate blood, and Ruthless killers. Death means less to them
			Bal'Jasar
				Slavers. I do not like Sogi, he is a cruel man, but his prices are fair. I have bolstered my ranks and built many ships with the slaves they have sold me. My mother was a slave you know. 
			Hatain
				Nazloe is a monk, not a captain. If it weren't for the threat of Kohlira, I'd say usurp her like you did the jaquy. 
			Bruchev
				we are your ally. For now. Do not cross us. I have told my first mate to inform the crew that you are to be treated AS bruchev. Think about that
			MacLeodquin
				Angle is a strange man. For all of the manaharamu comforts available, he is austere. As an ally, I would not know, he will not speak to me.
		
		
		The Fugin and the stockwoods have recovered the hostages from the avisen. 
	The avisen have retaliated in kind.

	Guy DeFer, previous, Guy DurFisher, at some point, mentions the Changeling threat, and how he hopes to survive. If prodded, he says to take a closer look at the alliances. The changelings are trying to keep their head down. The DurFisher know who to target, their information can always be bought in coin. He lies if asked if he knows
	
	Each crew seeks their own terms with the new Ship Tibeaux
		The barry are ambivbalent
		The Macleodquin sees them as irrelevant and asks what Lazarus is even doing here.
			Angle claims lazarus as a runt, who stumbled  tail first into an assassination attempt and that adding new alliances just further convolutes the situation
		Aik'no Fugin says it doesn't matter, Lazarus will be dead inside of a week. 
			Raker, Her subordinate says that Tibeaux has definitely bit off more than he can chew. It takes a lot to stay in this court.
		Quenchen rockwaller says there doesn't seem to be a need for violence. A fresh face is just a new chance to heal old wounds
		Eof Kveter would rather make friends than enemies.
		Oggy mire (decidente) seems eager to make a friend with the enemy of the macleodquin
		Shami murtuck looks   entirely eager to make an aliance
		Luciaria is flippant and dismissive
		Lagarach munsa is unreadable, but laughy
		The stockwoods are willing to approach the idea
		The durfisher say nothing
		The bal'jasar write notes to the hatain
	
	Jharkes Ravora offers  to meet later	
	
WORKS RUN, GUY DeFER MET.

WORKS COMPLETE

**Tibeaux has offered an alliance to the Rockwaller, Avisen, Murtuck, and DurFisher, they accept temporarily and without anything in writing, They Burned down Kidd's Corner to hush up witnesses.**
	
Jack ravora shows up at midnight, He wears a large captain's hat. He appears at the starboard side of the ship and waits there patiently to be welcomed aboard.
		With him, he has brought a tenser's floating disc upon which are a small sealed jar, a scroll, a tablecloth, Two cutlasses, a bag of coin, a bottle of poison and the wishbone out of some avian.
		
		I, Captain Jarhkes Ravora come to bid Parley on behalf of the late Admiral Val'Trinipon Stockwood, Admiral of the Stockwood Company, Fleet admiral of the Kouokurursu Proximeter, The Holy Cede, the Anklebiting Quipper, The Dracon Wellspring, The Yellow Apple, The Wavetimer, the Eldritch Dichotomy, And sisters, for the purposes of Alliance, Surrender, Bargain, or Warfare unlimited with the Right Admiral Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux, Admiral of the Tibeaux Company, Fleet admiral of the Bloody Sister, The Hell and High Water, The Unaffiliated Validator, The Cartomancer's Call, The Botenboat, The Game of Michael, The Scorned Letter, The Provicia, The Rainslider, the Mongrel Slut, and sisters. ARE YOU HE? 
		
		WHO IS YOUR SECOND?
				**Iyrelm is named second**
		THEN WE DINE. 
		
		A Bell rings from the port side of the ship. "Delivery for "the right hon....shit, why is this so long?..sister....validator... TIBEahUCKS! French Dragon!"
		
		Captain Ravora's eyes shine cold unblinking light but flicker momentarily toward the cart, before reaffixing on tibeaux. He Floats over to the port side of the ship, the bag of coin following behind him. He pays the man, keeps the bag, turns it inside out, then looks expectantly back at the crew. 
		If anyone on the crew beats an int or inv check of 13, they can tell he wants them to come get it and bring it aboard the ship.
		
		The meal is Modest, and contains Two hot Phoenix Sandwiches with green sea-turtle gravy, three bottles of ale, and a single piece of cake.
		
		Jharkes spreads out the tablecloth across the TFD and ties the bottom of it tight, forming a bag around the disc. He hands the cake to the named second.
		
		When the meal is done, Jharkes tosses the dishes off the dock and into the water.  He then stands up and passes one of the cutlasses to Tibeaux, then checks his own, but leaves it sheathed. 
		
		"ARE WE AT WAR?"
		**No**
		"DO YOU SWEAR UNENDING FEALTY TO THE STOCKWOOD?"
		**No**
		"DO YOU DEMAND UNENDING FEALTY OF THE STOCKWOOD?"
		**No**
		"WE DEMAND RIGHT OF CONQUEST TO THE TREASURE AT THE HEART OF THIS ISLAND, SOVREIGN UNFETTERED COURSE FROM THESE PORTS, AND TWO CRATES OF GIN. IN EXCHANGE, WE OFFER SOVREIGN AND UNFETTERED COURSE FROM THESE PORTS AND TWO CRATES OF GIN" 
		**We shall consider**
		"Right, let's get down to business. We wanna kill the avisen. What about you?
			Tibeaux wants to Marry the avisen. The Stockwood are surprised by this and wary
		We want The design to the stormpiercer from the Decidente. What about you?
			Tibeaux has granted this and asked for the same
		We want Two hundred thousand gold to bring our crew back to life after we get the treasure. What about you?
			Tibeaux has granted this in promise
		We want One week of alliance while we slit the throats of those damned Kveter-Klas
			Tibeaux has granted this
		We want Three cubic meters of High floating stone from the rockwallers, the Rite of Passage to the Danzuishanese Lochs from The Bruchev. 	
			Tibeaux has granted this in promise.
			
	At the end of this, the entirety of the stockwood crew, satisfied, Left from where they were hiding underneath the Party's ship 
	**This actually went perfectly, Each one of Jharke's traditions has a story behind it, where once in pirate history it had mattered. Can you imagine what stories were needed to make all this tradition?**
	
The Consort With Luciaria Avisen
		You are greeted with a cold, stone rectangle of a room with a low roof. There is thin white light streaming in through a cloudy window, giving the room a sickly look. The flagstone tiles and walls are green, tinged black by the shadows. There is a single unburnt candle on a bracket on the wall in the middle of the room. 
		
		Luciaria greets tibeaux and she is wearing very little, A short thick light blue Cotton bathrobe only. She looks bored, disappointed, but slightly intruigued. There is some blood on her lips. Her long white hair is up in a hasty bun.
			 "Monsieur Tibeaux, Why are you here?"
			 
			Luciaria is the sort of person who hates being chained by *anything* 
				Suggestions that someone has power over her are met with violent tantrum
				
				Suggestions that someone who thinks they have power over her will lose the illusion that power are met with enthusiasm. She will do just about anything if it offends someone, the more important that someone, the better. In this case, Tibeaux's offer for marriage will only be accepted if it will offend everyone on the island. 8
				
				If someone manages to convince her that they care about her and they haven't suggested a course of action, then she will eventually break down crying. She is troubled, damaged and entirely uncertain about her future. When She signed into her pact, it was for power, but now that she has this power, it does almost nothing for her.
	
				Luciaria is bored quickly but can be Distracted with small animals (which she tortures if someone is watching but ignores if someone is not). Gifts containing chocolate can help placate her, gifts containing blood will not. She enjoys clothing, the more scandalous without being entirely revealing, the better. 
		
				Luciaria is not prudish or shy. Shock value is her Modus Operandi. 
				
				**Well, that was a lot of crits, they're uh... Married now. Lazarus is now Admiral Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux-Avisen **

The Plot focuses currently on the politics between the pirate captains. The workings of the cult on the island are slow and subtle
		With the Murtucks secure in the alliance, Tulio's crew will begin raiding ships in Eastport, Cycling south to avoid Tibeaux's Faction. 
		The Westport Angels are moving their game table further out into the harbor, piling up rocks so they dangle their legs in the water.		
				
		The Enemy crews do not sit idly by.
		The Fugin, Hatain, and Kveter-Klas Ally Swiftly and attack the DurFisher early in the morning
		The lobby is raided and much blackmail is raided
		The DurFisher, Currently at 200 members Look to The alliance for aid. 
			Depending on their response, Quenchen Rockwaller will either Entirely betray the DurFisher or voice his concern about their weakness.
						
	Zog has cast seeming turning the furi dining room into flesh patches

	The other party has flattened building and is sieging the furi compound

			Slovenka remains unharmed but Autry will need over a week to re-establish her army of skeletons. Mawe is Heavily injured.
		The hatain ready to strike against the bruchev, Rockwaller, and Tibeaux, this news comes from the DurFisher.	

		After the Defeat of Nazloe Hatain, The Cult decides the Avisen-Tibeaux Alliance is too powerful to realiable contest. Quenchen Rockwaller is seen as the largest target, Being the only member of the alliance that is intent on getting the treasure. 
		Upon Being Target, the Furi absorb the Hatain and Replace them in the counter-tibeaux alliance. The entire remainder of the island is essentially unified against the alliance. 		
**the party has decided to seige the Furi, especially upon learning that Tibeaux's Father was killed by Lagarach.**		
		
Ongrum bonesnap is a rogue with a dagger and she is extremely loyal to the Furi. Roll intiative, she stabs thymae
		Once she is dead (and I imagine she is), An investigation check is required to find the mechanism for the secret door
		
	The Furi tunnels are treacherous, and a simple investigation check is required to spot the places where they are rigged to collapse

The tunnels Follow a Predictable pattern. Trap, Brace, Trap, sideroom, Brace, Trap. The Siderooms are  Where the treasure is held
**The traps are deadly traps, doing 14d10 if tripped. This actually knocked out the paladin in one shot. But players are clever, they learn to get around stuff like this, such as with Gaseous form or doing what my players did. They realized the walls were less than a foot thick and plowed through those instead of trying the hallway. Got most of the treasure on the way.**

	Quenchen Rockwaller Has connected the Rockwaller and DurFisher Hideouts via tunnel. 
	**Some explanation, The Durfisher compound was built on a large chunk of floating stone. The Rockwallers, spying on them, built their compound on the bottom, and hid it with the same magic**
	"Ah, I didn't expect you back so soon, from up here, the siege is still ongoing. How did that fare?" "and what about the naked one? The dryad" "...I am sorry for your loss"
	
		Ghuivere is Wordlessly furious.
	"Oh come on, Ghuivere, You bought the stone from us, We knew to watch what you were going to do with it."
	
	G "But the wards-"
	"Do not defend against hawks or a decent telescope, or at least they didn't until the whole thing was made invisible, but by that time, We already had our circle on it." 
	
	He Mentions that the MacLeodquin have begun marshalling their forces. There had been a major boost in warlocks on the island, but it seems that now, all of them have lost their power, all save those of the MacLeodquin. Angle MacLeodquin has been spotted moving from Westport through to southport. He travels at a leisurely pace. In the short day that you've eradicated the hatain and the furi, A large portion of the Bruchev forces have been Enslaved by the Bal'Jasar. The Fugin, Battered and wounded though they are, have bombarded the Jaquy compound with "black rubber bombs." The Kveter-Klas Have attempted a raid of the Rockwaller Compound and entirely taken the stock of pumice. Between the two, Fugin and Kveter-Klas, their ships are now extremely hard to sink. The

	Tibeaux's Orders
			Word to Jack to ambushed the ambush of the kveter klas trying to retrieve willy -P.S. Kill Eof, diamonds upcoming --Refused
	Fortify bruchev as much as possible.
	Take everything of value to the shivering spine, and fortify it - done
	Jaquy forces fortify 
	Shami pressure angle, send Tulio - Paid off Tulio's theft
	Tell Marco, to get stormpiercers, parlay - Marco has Parlayed
	Talk to the barry
	All everybody be prepared for a huge influx of hatain furi and bruchev soldiers. Do the truth thing. 
	7 Day plan
	Everyon else go to sea. 
		
		The Decidente Prepare Jacob Mullins to Attack Westport, but that is foiled by the westport angels
		
		The Fugin Send in Both Raker and Thanderal to deal with the Tibeaux directly. Thanderal shows up on a skiff, he leaves peacefully if a []
		**Whoops, didn't finish the notes. The Fugin negotiation went like this:**
		**The party killed lagarach and set up a meeting with the Fugin. **
		**Aik'no shows up first, **//almost//** solos the party, gets given an ultimatum, and chooses to surrender her forces and leave alive. **
		**Her minions show up after to find out that they have a new boss**
	
	**Angle showed up on their ship to negotiate. Negotations went south when they misinterpreted some word. Fight's on**
	Angle has turned into the roc
	
		It has been an eventful 18 days. 
	Angle is dead, Shuri has turned into a giant roc, her thirst for vengeance corrupted her.
	
	**in comes the barry encounter**
		The Barry Monster has surfaced several times, it is now night, and the attacks are about to cease for a few hours.
	The Party has discovered how to avoid the Monster's Maws and now walks largely unhindered. Grog, the chef of the Shivering Spine has dipped tibeaux's feet in Caramel and salt, creating a sufficiently thick layer. Everyone else has installed silver on their feet
	The Party Also talked to Marco Decidente who asked them to find out what was causing his sister's illness, Marco has implicated the Arcanoloth
	The Barry Monster stops attacking at sundown, giving those on the island a chance to sleep or leave.
	This next part didn't happen
	At some point, Nathaniel LeRequin Shows up to attack tibeaux and washes away the salt on his feet.
	**Tibeaux managed to get some salted caramel from the shivering spine so he wouldn't have to fear the mouths at all**
	
	Barry's dead tho 
	
	**The party actually got a hold of a broken astral pirate ship which got repaired near the end**
 
	
	the barry are hella dead tho. 
Tibeaux, Luciaria, Ghuivere durfisher, Quenchen Rockwaller, Sogi Bal'Jasar, Sogi's wife, Smuntsu Sinfulnumber, Val'Trinipon Stockwood, Shami Murtuck and Combartch Tc'tcaeri, Willie Klas, Eof and Anna are all in the court of the pirate kings. 
Trinipon has willy, 
Itir's summon went off, 
Luciaria's lost her warlock powers hiding behind tibeaux
Ghuivere is invisible
Cosades has prepped his crossbow subtly, 
Combartch has his bone rod.
Krelthar has prepped abjure enemy on the pitfiend
Anna Still has cosades at swordpoint, 
Smuntsu Has Detect thoughts up
	
	
	
WELL FUCK I GUESS THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN
	Howte Cosades Is probably Summoned
	Combartch and Smuntsu are immediately stunned for one turn. Anna Immediately attacks Jack. Jack Targets Tibeaux. Eof Targets Luciaria. Quenchen Attacks Smuntsu, Ghuivere Runs outside to call for reenforcements, Luciaria Attacks Smuntsu. Shami Runs out the other way, Closely Followed by Sogi and his wife, 
	
	
	If Smuntsu wins, he enslaves the island
	If Combartch wins, the cult reveals itself as a major force on the plane and begins to wage a quick war
	If Val'trinipon wins, the Stockwood Ghosts pirates Stand still for a few moments before stealing everyone's treasure with magic and leaving for *somewhere*
	If Eof or Anna Klas win, They hold a pretty big party. They have some petty mortal standards here.
	If Sogi Bal'Jasar Wins, everyone is slaves, start campaign again
	
**Party wins. Tibeaux is the Immortal King Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux-Avisen-Bruchev.**	
Quenchen rockwaller is now Quenchen Devilfear because it turns out pit fiends don't have particularly good saves against that.

	
	
Player's Favourites
	Clara: Either the battle with Angle Macleodquin or the Murder of Memory Jaquy via Unicorn
	**Krelthar was one of the ones  who fought Angle, along with cosades, He teleported out via dimension door (twice) to angle's back where they pulled some Shadow of the colossus gameplay.**
	Amy: I think it might have been the part where krelthar and tibeau infiltrated memorys place and ended up getting caught and thymae did a fire breath as a mouse and tibeau goes thats my cook then cosades comes in cackling with lightning and tibeaus like thats my accuntant and we just end up taking down his compoind
	**Owing to a few acts of god, Thymae, a dryad, ended up with some powerful dragon breath, which it turns out is usable in beast fom as a druid. Tibeaux was fantastic face owing to his ability to play off every situation as if he had planned it all along. Very Jack Sparrow like**
	Vey: Id say krelthar and cosades vs the mythic Roc was pretty fucking badass
	**As a magic item, Cosades had a staff that allowed him to redirect a ranged attack as a reaction. Angle got hit with his own buffet attack and that's what killed him**
	Lee: My favorite part? Jeez, hard to say. Killing Lagarach mostly, the moment it went from conquering for shits to personal character stake
	**Lee made this campaign by engaging with the world on an intricate basis. This is one of the rare times a backstory was easy to work in. Lee Played Tibeaux.**
	Bailey: my favorite part was when Zog met the westbrook(Port) angels 
	T**hat was silly. Crit int check versus Mirikius to play Reversi. She rolled a 2 on dice.**
	

DM's Favourites:
	It's a fair split between Tibeaux's reaction to learning that Lagarach Munsa killed his father, or the moment that they ambushed aik'no and almost got Solo'd in return. That felt really good
	
**as of 5854, lavinia has joined the red mist pirates**

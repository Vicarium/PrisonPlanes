====== Skill Check Weapons ======
Created Sunday 29 March 2020


Skill tactic basic weapon table Rundown

Personal Problems: are situations where you are immediately involved and engaged, such that you must be constantly alert for the dangers (such as in a melee)
Distant Problems: are situations where you have a moment to plan or only need to expect limited problems (such as ranged attacks)

A skill challenge must be measured in a few ways
	PP: Problem points, the scope of the problem for how much work you need to do to solve it. (HP, maybe one for each stat?)
	IU: Intensity Units, a measure of how much you rush and difficulty changing tactics. (distance/range)
	DC: Dice check, Difficulty Class. The problems presented as you work. (DC, equivalent of AC)
	
	A skill challenge can become more difficult! (Has attacks and abilities like wind, Dramatic twists, and Dragonfire!)
	Some skill challenges can be outright solved by other means. (A windy cliff means nothing to a wizard with the ability to teleport)

	Precaution: +2 to checks against failure and saves, you cannot be committed to a tactic while you take these precautions, it takes an action to take precautions and it takes another action to do away with them. You cannot use anything significant while taking precautions,
	
	One off: Essentially limited use for a single use if you're distant with it. You'll have to get pretty personal and inspect the problem up close or within range of its effects to see the results (like a thrown weapon)
	
	Extra: (light) can't be used with Significant or committed	

	Easy Assistance special: If you have access to someone who is able to provide you with some extra oomph at the cost of their own solutions, This isn't considered significant. If you aren't cautious with it, you have disadvantage on the check
	Stunning comparison special: If the challenge is large or smaller, you can Restrain it until it makes a DC 10 check of the same skill. Dealing 5 damage to the tactic itself (ac10)
	
At character creation you pick a set of Tactics for each ability score, using the following list to describe each set. You may choose each set only once so no ability score has the same set:
	Any Three
	Any Two and one basic
	Any One and Two basic
	One Trained, One basic
	Two basic
	One basic
	
Brushing up and inspecting for limited approaches
	some ideas require verification and your character needs to assess the value of an idea and to do research before they would reasonably attempt such a thing again. (this functions identically to ammunition)

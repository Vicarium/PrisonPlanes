Diplomats
	Oggy Mire ISTJ
		One of Marco's inner circle who largely does the deals for the stormpiercers. He's well respected around town but drives a hard bargain
	
	Moonbeam Brumia INFP
		A tremendously powerful hippy. Nearly incapable of hating things, but also immune to almost all forms of magic. She once tapped into the energy of the moon (the eldritch abomination allabar, opener of the way) and was able to extract herself from its influence, and escaped with a great many lessons on the nature of the inborne magic of the weave, residuum, and the nature of love. Because she is immune to magic, she is one of the most reliable messengers, but she is spacey and unfocused. 
		
	Jacob Mullins ESTJ
		A much more traditional pirate captain, an excellent sailor and "not sure about all this moon magic, but well aware of the nature of the market". He is sent to dish out the more....sinister dealings of decidente

Ship Kveter-Klas
	Leaders
		Eof (yeff) Kveter (ranger) ISTJ
			A half-orc who looks wise beyond his years. He is middle aged and stands at 6'3. His Grey-brown hair is brushed into a high cowlick and seems to defy gravity slightly. He has Trident and has gloves made of bone. His skin is grey. He has a Dwarven thrower....trident. When reading he wears half-moon spectacles.
				 Swedish accent "ae half oorque hoo luuks wais beyund he yeers"
				 
		Marie-Anna Klas ESTJ
			A fragile shell of a human woman whose son was imprisoned in the Jaquy compound. She is a vicious assassin, or was until her son was imprisoned. She is the heiress to the Klas half of the Kveter-Klas, and is highly resistant to magic. She constantly wears her mottled grey clothes
			
	Important people
		Marek Kveter (Barbarian, Totem) ESTP
			A half orc who very much delights in the benefits of his race. He is loud, brutish, and aggressive, but, unlike his deceased father, not arrogant enough to start problems where they don't need to be. He is the nephew of Eof, and is still learning his peoples' customs and traditions
			
		James Klas (Raven Queen Warlock) INFP
			James is the uncle of Willy Klas and Brother to Marie. He is a bit upset that he was passed over for the position of heir but works tirelessly to recover his nephew. He's a well spoken individual and a spokesman for the family when Eof is unavailable.
				Lore note, While it's not relevant to the story, James is one of the incredibly few transgendered individuals, having engaged in a fantastic amount of robbery to afford the True Polymorph procedure at the University of Manaharamu.
			
	Location (5)) mid southwest
		A well armed warehouse of a building, inside of which are several smaller buildings, some with square human houses and others with round orcish huts.

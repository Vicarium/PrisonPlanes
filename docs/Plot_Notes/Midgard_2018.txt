Currently the party intends to move south for two reasons. Vaylen wants some Octarine Pigment and Gaius wants the Rod of lordly might 

sparkles stilll wants nothing, Barnabal has left, Zul remains along for the ride. beatrix has yet to make her entrance

This is a time for tension to increase.  
The factors that WILL increase the tension are: 
	* Moseie's Visit to Manaharamu
	* Their journey either up mohara or across a stretch of Kavir-e'namak should have an increase as well. One of the Kholirahi Generals? A dragon? Now that they have a goal, is that where the drama comes from?

Moseie Does not wish to deal with these two wayward spawn anymore. He has informed a Dao of their existence and location. This dao, Mayin lo'oshpot, is a crafty creature.
	* Outside of the city, in the desert (N-1)*2 (two for each creature) animated manacles (**Ac 19, 15hp, +5 to hit or target is bound in manacles. Dex save +5, immune to the same things other constructs are**)  erupt from the sand. This is where **four Earth elementals and Four Gargoyles** emerge from the ground themselves and attempt to take the party hostage. Nets are used for the smaller members.
	* If they are successful, Iunno, honestly. Looks like the next arc is to break out of Mayin's palace
	* If the elementals fail to capture the Party, Then Mayin puts up a bounty, one that it quickly picked up by the Yuan-ti of Ctutoletl.
	* The yuan-ti do their best to hunt down this party before they get to Mana Ulla
		* while it is impossible to predict a party beforehand, It is worth laying out potential Yuan-ti plans
		* Attacking openly isn't the Yuan-ti style so they might wait until the party returns to  town.
		* The yuan-ti will spy on the party with their snake forms in the jungle to learn their weaknesses
		* The Yuan-ti will attempt a series of pitfalls and a buffalo-jump
		* If that fails, the yuan-ti will use their magic
			* They will start by picking off extraneous members of the party with Eldritch blast from maximum range. 
			* They will then turn to using hypnotic pattern or other mind-control magic.
			* They will then bind every member of the party in shackles and have them brought to the altar for the exchange
		* In Ctutoletl, they will learn the name of their pursuer, Mayin, from one of the Yuan-ti Malisons. This will deflect their anger away from the yuan-ti if they escape
Conquering the yuan-ti will provide a release of tension, hopefully before they reach Mana Ulla. 

I want Mana Ulla to be a brief coda in the tension. Kemalabet is essentially tension incarnate. This hollow city is her hole, where she hides from her guilt. That guilt has lasted over two thousand years. She refuses to face it and uses her power to keep this place to herself. When she wants to talk to someone, she has many ways of doing so. Lokpra isn't very good conversation so Kemalabet ignores him. Her current ritual is a song that 

**Having beaten the elementals, the party heads toward Mana Ulla and thus, toward the Yuan-ti city of ctutoletl**

In a Random encounter, the Party has encountered two Ancient Dragons fighting, Blue and brass. One of the party helped the brass dragon by slowing the blue, allowing a quick and decisive victory. The blue ferried them partway down the Dragon forest until, unbeknownst to the party, a Yuan-ti Anathema managed to **Suggest** that the dragon land and see to its treasure. The Yuan-ti attack is underway. None of the Yuan-ti are dead but they are running low on spells

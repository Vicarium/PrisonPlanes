Enscorceled Trussari
	The Enscorceled Trussari is a great boss to throw at players to introduce a story and give them pause, Are their abilities really that valuable? What enemies do they face?
	The Trussari begins the fight looking sick, but on the first hit against him, that vanishes. He stands tall, proud and angry, and his eyes begin fuming green smoke. 
	The Trussari has an Antimagic field that projects 10ft from him. He is a Fighter 7 samurai, Monk 3 Kensei

====== College of Terror ======
Created Tuesday 25 February 2020

//We can't let them in. We won't allow those monsters into our community. They praise the unknown and sow ignorance. This is anathema to the Manarahi way of life. We would see schisms and dissent as people begin to chase their fears instead of the future.//
	--~~Nirrum the mad~~ **Ekud the Uncanny**


The college of terror are bards who specialize in evoking fear, confusion, and a sense of danger within their audience. A terror bard might be a musician whose music slowly degenerates as light flickers around them, doors and windows slam open and shut. They might be a traveller who spots campfires and asks for food in exchange for stories. They might be a village elder or schoolteacher who needs to teach a lesson about some great danger to otherwise foolhardy children. They might not be behind you. They might be adventurers or sworn protectors or people with an awful oath to fulfill. Many people flock to the feeling of fear that these bards can create, then lie awake at night wondering what horror could be underneath their bed or just outside their walls. Many people pay good money to drum up fear of the unknown, and to instill uncertainty in carefully carved words. Make no mistake, these are bards, they are curators of experience foremost, and they use their magic to make a creature feel fear themself. Their style is rarely to frighten someone, but to instead let their own minds do the work, to confuse them, and if they can feel fear, they likely will.


**Bonus Cantrips. **
	When you join the College of Terror at 3rd level, you learn the cantrips Thaumaturgy and Control flames if you don't already know them.

**Distracting, Creeping, Trickery. **
	At 3rd level, You find Incredible ways to force your foes attention on things you want them to notice, and away from things they should have paid attention to. When a creature that can see or hear you within 30ft of you makes a Perception check, Insight check, or Saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the ability check or saving throw succeeds or fails.  In addition you gain the ability to throw your voice, both nonmagically up to five feet and magically up to 30ft to a space or solid object within range. This ability cannot pass through solid obstacles

**Horrid lies, Awful Truths.**
	You craft what your foes can know is true and false by making everything both. At 6th level you learn the spell //Nystul's Magic// //Aura. //It is a bard spell for you and does not count toward your spells known. Also, as a bonus action on your turn, you may begin harmonizing with the signs of magic within 120ft of you for ten minutes, until you are incapacitated, or until you drop concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). While you are harmonized, if a spell or magical ability has a visual effect that you can see or an audio effect that you can hear, then you may create an illusory duplicate of that effect at a point within 120ft of you.  A creature that uses its **action** to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Physical interaction with the visual effect reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the visual effect until you harmonize with a new effect or the ability ends. You can only maintain one such effect at a time, and if an effect lasts more than one round, you may use a bonus action to maintain it. Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you do so again.


**Despicable, Gnawing, Terror.**
	As a bonus action on your turn  you may grant yourself a bardic inspiration die. During the next minute you may roll this die and add the total to your saving throw. If you succeed on the saving throw, you are immune to any other effects of the spell, ability, or effect that caused you to make it until the start of your next turn, You monster. This die lasts until it is used or for one minute

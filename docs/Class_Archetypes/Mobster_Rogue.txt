====== Mobster Rogue ======
Created Wednesday 19 February 2020

You're not like the other rogues, you don't work alone. You are part of a gang or group, and your boss has taught you a few tricks. Eldritch tricks. You're not sure where they got it and they don't teach these to everyone. Either that, or someone taught you when they shouldn't have. Maybe you grabbed the cheat sheet. Either way, you've got a posse to keep.


**Pact Magic.**
	When you reach 3rd level in this class, you are granted some spellcasting knowledge. Your boss has some ideas of what needs to be done. 
	
	**Cantrips. **
		You know one cantrip from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at 9th and 17th level. You can change out which cantrips you know whenever you gain a level in this class
		
	**Spell slots. **
		You have one first level warlock spell slot. You get an extra warlock spell slot once you reach 9th level in this class and another at 17th. When you reach 9th level your warlock spell slots all become second level, and at 17th level in this class, your slots all become third level. If you already have the pact magic feature, your warlock spell slots have a level equal to the highest level granted by either class. You regain all expended warlock spell slots when you finish either a **short** or a long rest.
		
	**Eldritch Invocations.**
		To get the Job done, you learn one Warlock invocation of your choice. All prerequisites for an invocation must be met, as per agreement. You can replace an invocation you have with another invocation that you could learn at that level whenever you gain a level in this class.   At 13th level you can know 2 invocations at a time, at 17th, you can learn 3.

	**Spells known. **
		You know a number of warlock spells equal to half your rogue level, rounded down. You can replace one warlock spell that you know with another warlock spell that you have the spell slots for when you gain a level in this class

	**Spellcasting ability. **
		Your choice of either Charisma or intelligence becomes your spellcasting ability modifier.  Spell Save DC = 8  + Proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
		

**Grandpatron's Standards.**
	When you choose this Archetype at 3rd level, You gain one of the following options
		Fey - You gain proficiency in the performance skill and Cobbler's Tools
		Fiend - You gain proficiency in the Intimidation and Weaver's Tools
		Great Old One - You gain proficiency in the Investigation and Barber's tools
		Celestial - You gain proficiency in the Persuasion and Jeweller's Tools
		Hexblade - You gain proficiency in the Deception and smith's Tools
		Undying - You gain proficiency in the Medicine and Leatherworker's Tools
	While you or your allies are wearing or wielding an item made with your tool set, they can add your charisma or intelligence modifier to the associated skill. You can only grant this bonus to a number of people equal to your charisma or intelligence modifier.

**Grandpatron's Expertise.**
	At 9th level, You represent a group of fine talents and you make your grandpatron proud if they're aware of you. You gain expertise in your Grandpatron's associated skill and tool proficiency. You and your allies wearing one of your empowered items gain a bonus to the associated skills associated with other Grandpatrons equal to half your charisma or intelligence modifier while benefitting from your Grandpatron's standards.

**Eyes on Me.**
	Starting at 13th level, you can use your bonus action to force one creature you see to make a charisma saving throw. Creatures who cannot be charmed are immune to this effect. On a failed save all creatures other than you (as well as objects they are wearing or holding) become invisible to the target. The Target has disadvantage on any check made to percieve any other creature. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can attempt to make this save again. This effect ends if the target takes damage or is forced to make a saving throw from a different spell or ability. Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before your can use it again.

**Arcane** **Mafioso.**
	Starting at 17th level, you and your people are a well-oiled machine. At this point, you're probably in charge of something. You gain a benefit depending on your choice of Grandpatron to aid your allies in battle. You also no longer suffer the effects of  aging nor can you be aged magically.
		**Fey. **Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead cast the spell S**low** without using a spell slot or components targetting only the creature you hit. The effects of this spell last until the start of your next turn and do not require concentration
		**Fiend. **Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead cast **Bestow Curse** without using a spell slot or components targetting only the creature you hit.
		**Great Old One. **Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead cast **Banishment**  without using a spell slot or components targetting only the creature you hit.  The effects of this spell last until the start of your next turn and do not require concentration
		**Celestial.** Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead cast **Remove Curse, **or **Dispel magic, **without using a spell slot or components targetting only the creature you hit or an ally within range.
		**Hexblade.** Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead have the creature you hit takes a **penalty to attack rolls** equal to the number of sneak attack dice you would roll.  This effect lasts until the start of your next turn and do not require concentration
		**Undying. **Instead of dealing damage on your sneak attack, you may instead roll your sneak attack dice and either you or a creature that can see or hear you can **regain that many hit points**.

**Special invocation**
	**Sneaky blast. **
		//Prerequisite Mobster, Eldritch blast cantrip//
			You can also use your sneak attack feature when you hit with an eldrtich blast. As usual you must either have advantage or there must be another enemy of the target within 5ft of it, and you can only use sneak attack once per turn.

====== Dragon Domain ======
Created Monday 17 February 2020



==== Dragon Domain ====
Nature, Life, light, tempest, knowledge, war, all domains of the gods are the domains of dragons, and in Many cases, their right. Tamara, Zorquan, Astilabor, Io, are all gods of //Dragons, representing dragons//.  They symbolize personal drive, wealth, progress, self-care, strength, having wings and breathing magic.  Many of their clerics are selfish and evil, but some are not and are glue to a community. This domain is the one that is most likely to choose clerics //regardless of that person's wishes. //These clerics exist to serve dragons, to become dragons, to teach lessons to dragons that need to be reminded that their gods are dragons to, or on occasion, these clerics exist to become dragons, to embody draconic essence, and take what is rightfully theirs. This domain may manifest for other gods, such as gods of pride, greed, civilization, or self improvement. Here on this plane though, it most frequently means dragons.

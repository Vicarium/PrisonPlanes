~~Mythweft~~
	~~When you reach 18th level, You recieve one  based on your choice of talespinning from 1st level~~
	
~~Lore. You have captured some power that stood beyond your grasp. You learn one spell from any spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you and does not count toward your spells known. If it has the ritual tag, you can perform that spell as a ritual.~~
~~Valor. Tales do not end without your say-so. As a reaction, you can spend two sorcery points to add or subtract your charisma modifier to an attack or damage roll made by a creature within 60ft of you. ~~
~~Glamour. Your stunning presence is too powerful to harm, you made sure of that. As a reaction, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can spend two sorcery points to force that creature to make a Charisma saving through against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it must choose a new target for the attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save it has disadvantage against your spells on your next turn.~~
~~Swords. All magic seems to come from your sword. When you damage a creature with a spell cast through your chosen melee weapon, you may roll your weapon's damage and add it to the damage total.~~
~~Whispers. You pick apart the remnants of the dead to learn what could have hurt them. When a creature dies within 30ft of you, you capture its shadow. You learn all information that the creature would freely share with a casual acquaintance as well as a single ruinous secret that the target would not wish its enemies to know.  You also gain the ability to unerringly mimic the target's voice if it has one. You can only have one such shadow at a time~~ 



~~Terror. You sing fear into creatures that can feel it, and force those who have never known it to experience it.  As a bonus action Creatures of your choice within 60ft of you that can hear you have disadvantage against effects that would cause them to be frightened. Those creatures lose immunity to the Frightened condition if they have it. This effect lasts for one minute. You can spend a sorcery point to extend the duration to one hour, or two sorcery points to extend it to 8 hours.~~

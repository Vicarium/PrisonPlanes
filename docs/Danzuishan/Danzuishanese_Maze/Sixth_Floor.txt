====== Sixth Floor-Samasara ======
Created Monday 29 April 2019

The Smell of Floral soap and Vinegar fill this floor, as the fluids from the room above. Depending on where the party entered this floor from, they'll either be in Room 1, 2, or 3. 

1) A Floor of obsidian coated in vinegar that is perpetually beind turned into steam. The room is steamy and creatures without acid resistance or some sort of sealed eye protection are blinded by vinegar steam while they are in the room. Even a light breeze is enough to blow away the steam. 
	* The room is Triangular with sides 60ft long. 
	* If the Vinegar stream from the cieling is stopped, the floor begins to melt over the next hour and is quite clearly lava.
	* In the room, there's a series of large, conical Univalve shells of different types sitting in the lava unharmed. They are spaced in such a way that a jump from one to the other requires a DC 10 acrobatics check to not fall into the lava
	* Falling into the lava causes a creature to take 18d10 and if a creature is reduced to 0hp, if they have any water content in their bodies, they **explode violently, spraying Lava and steam in a 30ft radius around them. Creatures within the area after two rounds must make a dexterity saving throw of 14 or take 1d10 fire damage.**
	* Dry flammable material will begin to light in this room if the lava is active
	* The shells are nacrous and worth 200gp total for the harvestable parts above the obsidian
	* A single hellhound lurks in the shadows and attacks the weakest members

A Door leads from one of the corners of this room to room (2), another to room (7) and another to room 6

2) A room filled entirely with bubbles. 
	* The light in here is bright white light that is somewhat muted by the abundance of foam. 
	* Creatures in the room are distorted visually as if they are under the effects of the mirror image spell, their duplicates re-appear when they move. 
	* A white neothelid slides through the room. 
	* The room is claw-shaped with one long arced wall and two smaller arced walls, one leading to room 1, one to room 3, and one to room 7.
	* Hidden among the foam is a tome of Clear thought, with a bookmark in it that functions as a +1 dagger. The tome bears the visage of an extremely angry looking Elf, and a note inside the front cover reading, in elvish "The truth cannot be cleaned"
	* the floor is bowled slightly allowing fluid to flow into a strange pit in the floor. The Pit is shaped like the inside of a water fountain in the shape of a Planetar. Flowing fluid disappears when inside this hollow.



3) This room is a 200ftsphere that contains many cogs, gears, chains, and 12 Monodrones that work tirelessly to oil the gears, Dust from the gear moving is swept into a hellfire engine at the bottom of the sphere. The hellfire engine moves to attack the players, destroying its way through the grated catwalk that covers the area 15ft above the bottom of the sphere, and climbing rails made for it to get to the second floor, where the players are, at the center of the sphere. Underneath the hellfire engine is a door that leads to room 7. If the players came from **floor 5, they came through the top of the room. **One door on either side of the center of the dome leads to room 2 and the other to room 4

4) This room is A vertical spire with no ladder Upward. A pit in the floor leads to room 7 changing gravity as one steps through it, A door on one side of the eye-shaped floor leads to room 3, while the other leads to room 5.  The room is 30ft long and 15ft wide.
	* The floor of this room is coated in tar and is difficult terrain to walk through, a creature that has fallen prone in this room requires a strength (athletics) check of 18 to stand. Removing tar from a creature takes 7 days of active cleaning unless exposed to both soap and vinegar, which reduces the time to three days. Lamp oil can reduce the time by a further three days, in the meantime the creature feels sticky and gross.
	* A Desk Bearing an infernal contract for one soul in exchange for one cast of the wish spell for anyone who signs it sits in the middle of the room. 
	* At the top of the room

5) This room is a teardrop-shaped cone with rust monsters attacking the head of a large golden statue that looks as an extremely angry elf. The rust monsters are all starving and die from any damage. If the gold is removed from the statue, it yeilds 5000 gold worth of gold, 5000 silver worth of silver, 60lb of pink plastic foam, and a peaceful, expressionless version of the same head. This version of the head is indestructible and can be placed in the air as a bonus action. Once placed this way, the only way it can move is if something with the intent to move it uses an action bonus action to do so. The creature does not need to be in direct contact with the object and can move it with the use of spells or abilities that could reasonably move an object. The head will not move for natural phenomena such as //unintentional// wind or waves. Once moved, it acts as mundane statue head until placed again

6) This room bears a small armory. Every item in this room is cursed, and enchanted by Nystul's Magic Aura to appear *to be the uncursed versions*.
	* Armor of Invulnerability (actually armor of Vulnerability)
	* Bag of Holding (Of Devouring)
	* A stone of luck (Ill luck)

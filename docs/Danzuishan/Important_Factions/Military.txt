	With an understanding of the schools that bring rise to these warriors, you should now have an understanding as to why they are undefeated. Even their local historians will point out that their civil war ended in a draw. Noted next to each individual is the school they have followed the most, which should give context to how they operate.
	
	 **The Beating Heart, Lord General** **Paj Remorhari** (INTP)(Endurance of Spirit)(Paladin 20 Oath Of Ancients)
		A Quiet gold dragonborn whose plots  keep his people safe
			Age: 46
			Height: 6'4
			Weight: 290
		Paj is a quiet man, considering his position, his class, and his methods. Paj spent a lot of time in the schools of Two hundred hearts and Purity of Thought, though he was a natural in the school of Immediate action. He wears Adamantine Armor of Invulnerability, decorated with the symbols of the Vined Trout and Flashpike on each breast and with the words "Follow me Forward, The River's Rush" in Draconic on the back. He wields an Adamantine Holy Avenger, An Oakeshott XI with the hilt inlaid with the symbol of St. Cuthbert, and carries a kite shield with the symbol of Danzuishan upon it.  Despite his "Strong arm, Strong Tongue" archetype, Paj is an exceptional Tactician. Any fight against Paj is a war of attrition. There have been no less than nine Attempted assassinations that he has brushed off or ended personally. Outwardly, Paj looks sleepy, his eyes focusing mostly on puzzles in front of him. He is lazy in many personal respects but in manners of state, he is extremely forward-thinking. He is not spectacularly approachable but has a few close friends. Paj was and is a Maze-runner, and will frequently Dash into the maze and come out with new citizens and treasure.
		
	Brigadier General **Jandeer Punjidan** (ESTJ)(Presence of Mind)(Wizard 14 Divination)
		A cruel Black Dragonborn with an eye on multiple timelines
			Age: 66
			Height:6'6
			Weight: 264
		The school of the presence of mind and the school of the true void often overlap but the two rarely see pupils that also spend as much time in the school of Immediate action. Combined with a brief stint in the university of Manaharamu, and you're going to see a person with a clarity of mind that is likely hard to match. Jandeer definitely has that clarity. There is little doubt among his peers that he will make a fine devil in the hells someday, but for now he dutifully serves the people of Danzuishan. Jandeer wears fine black silk robes with copper thread trim and wields a wand of binding. He greatly enjoys granting painful deaths, though they tend to be swift. He also loves taking hostages.
	
	The Whirlwind General **Dest** **"Dusty" Gahabe** (ESFP)(Irrevocable Death)(Shadow Monk 11, rogue 2, Gloomstalker Ranger 3)
		A Wild Blue Dragonborn Ninja who intends to earn the highest rank of his arts.
			Age: 22
			Height: 5'9
			Weight: 210
		Members of the school of irrevocable death always go big or go home. Dusty commands a secretive (but simultaneously well known) band of spies and assassins. He's not the leader of them but he intends to be in the future. For now he makes his name as the shadowy and windswept hero of the people. His favourite targets are humanoids. His clothes are mottled grey, and tied close to his scales near the groin, ankles, forearms and armpits. He wields a (dancing) Wakizashi(shortsword), bracers of defense, and a medallion of thoughts. He frequently takes an assortment of magic items with him from his Monastery's Treasury. He is also often accompanied by his wife Easo Gahabe, A red dragonborn (gloomstalker 15, ISFP, Endurance of spirit) who is, let's be honest,  a far better ninja than he is
		
	The Eight-Spears General **Loka Mastani**(ENFP)(Two Hundred Hearts)(Fighter 13 Battlemaster)
		A Punchy Green General Who's Never Alone
			Age: 50
			Hieght: 6'9
			Weight: 300
		Loka is an effective fighter. There's no denying she is already a threat. What Makes Loka **terrifying **are the Seven other Dragonborn she will always have with her. She has hand-chosen these warfriends and they work with seamless teamwork, Using their battlemaster tactics to reposition and reallocate their resources. The eight spears of Danzuishan have always had a place in the military, and indeed were the first example of the ideology of The Echoing Immortality, but it has remained more of a badge. This particular batch of fighters isn't as effective as the others individually, but their teamwork is unrivalled. The crew all use dwarven plate and have spears that function as swords of wounding. The designs on their armor are striking Blue streaks over polished steel, with Loka's armor having gold trim. She finds people fantastic so long as they don't impede her, and has had more than one fight with the other spears because of this, but their brawling has served to strengthen their bonds.

	The Brawny General **Atlas Sowelo** (INFP)(Growing One)(Bear Totem Barbarian 6, Light Cleric 6, Brawny)
		This Goliath lifts, A god grants him higher levels of strength but he probably doesn't need it 
			Age: 35
			Hieght: 7'0
			Weight: 400
		Atlas Sowelo is almost certainly the strongest mortal to exist on this plane. Capable of carrying **extreme loads, with a carrying capacity of 4800. **Atlas can literally carry houses. He spends his time in the Maze with a large cart that he uses to carry out people and treasure. He'll act as a Depot for the other maze runners if they ask him and he'll safeguard the people in the maze himself until it becomes an opportune time to leave. He wears a shimmering shirt made of fish scales and heavy brown linen pants. He carries a Spellguard shield but is cursed by a shield of Missile attraction... Voluntarily. He also wears a barbutte that acts as a helm of comprehend languages. He heads into the maze daily to retrieve those lost in it, just as he was once, armed with a War Pick that glows a soft white light constantly.

====== Keina ======
Created Tuesday 19 March 2019

		Keina is the first town if you approach by sea. It sees a lot of stop-and-go trade from merchants who just want to drop off their goods and head on. It is not a particularly rich district though, as the goods are moved upriver to keep them safe from the consistently invading pirates. Infrastructure here is cheap but tough. Hard stone walls support red wooden pagodas. This is definitely a place to watch your wallet, it might wander off without you. It is also the location of the largest shipyards in Danzuishan.

		A small general store in the middle of Keina run by an old, gnarled and buff black dragonborn named Tejash. Tejash is easily recognizable as a kind individual who will let adventurers sleep on the top floor of his house above the store. Tejash sleeps in his back room, which is quite messy.

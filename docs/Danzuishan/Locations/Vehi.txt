A long flat section of the Gannaga River as it prepares to go around its last major tributary. This is one of the calmest parts of the river and the mosquitos are kept at bay only by the ludicrous amount of dragonflies that spawn in this part of town, the bats that are held sacred by the local temples, and the *extreme* diversity of spiders, also sacred. This part of the river sports the Danzuishanese Maze, the largest source of resources into danzuishan and the only reason that it is competetive

**The Hall of the Maze hunters**

The front room is mostly an office that functions as a museum. One door leads to the supply room and the other door leads to the barracks wherein Maze-hunters who are getting ready to go in to the maze go to prepare and to test their skills against one another

**House of Gono the blue, Temple of Zorquan**

All who live in Danzuishan pay him this respect. The tower sits on a high foundation on the inside curve of the river with a short dock leading to it. Gono protects Danzuishan alongside the two metallic dragons Athicanaraman and Vintaasklo from all sorts of threats that are greater than the Danzuishanese Military can handle. In Might, Gono,  is only challenged by Ujira the Vibrant who is known as the king of the dragons on snarl
	
**Roost of Vintaasklo the Copper**
	A thin platform with a low clay roof protects a large pile of books and red cushions. Upon the Largest of such red cushions lies Vintaasklo, an ancient copper dragon. Vintaasklo's Real lair is somewhere in the nearby hills, but he rests here so he can have access to the people Danzuishan. Vintaasklo is an extremely old dragon, his eyes like Gemstones unto themselves and his scales polished to a mirror sheen. He advises the queen in Economic issues, always for the betterment of Danzuishan. It is suspected that he is the reason for the extremely low Furi influence in the city, as it is likely that he runs the theive's guild.

**Roost of Athicanahraman **
		A modest sized platform that extends over the lock that contains a statue of the Ancient Bronze dragon that ostensibly lives there. In truth Athicanaraman is often patrolling the city looking for injustice or hiding in the river as a fish. Athicanaraman Is usually identifiable, even while Polymorphed by his missing right eye, a reminder of when his tyrannical sense of justice was brought low by Parineet Faugat. Parineet followed the school of the growing one until the tyranny of Athicanarahraman could not be ignored. Parineet hunted Athicanahraman and defeated him utterly in combat. He Removed Athicanahraman's eye while delivering a scornful breakdown of the laws that that Athicanahraman had broken himself in his quest for justice. Athicanahraman claims that he was going to eat Parineet after he lost his eye, but as Parineet spoke, a Canary landed on his shoulder and his voice shifted to that of Bahamut, the platinum dragon god of Law. His sense of justice was hard tempered after that and he went on a soul-searching journey into the desert for 22 years, returning after that time to find his hoard found and empty and the city flourishing without him. Instead of the rampage people expected of him, he laughed and got employed in the police force. He does not technically follow the rules that the Police force has to, as he still sees his own view of the law as correct, but the removal of his eye is a constant reminder to him that he can only see half of any picture.

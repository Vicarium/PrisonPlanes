====== Gausui ======
Created Friday 17 May 2019

		Gausui is a mirror of Keina, but also is where one of the river's largest distributaries begins. It is thus important to have a well maintained sliding dam that can redirect more or less of the river in the event of extreme rains to prevent flooding. Stone architecture picks up again here, but buildings are more spread out. The shore is stone-walled high to prevent floods from overtaking the town on the other side, though the side near the damn is far less protected or even maintained. This is where many of Danzuishan's lower class citizens live but also many of its seasonal citizens and traders, this part of town is still kept relatively safe to protect the frequently uninhabited buildings. Brick and plaster is the name of the game for architecture here, houses seldom have a second story. 

**Mori Silo**
	The Mori silo is where most of Danzuishan's poorest get their rice. The mori own many rice paddies just outside of Danzuishan where the river runs flat for a bit, and they keep their wares in large wooden barrels inside of the silo, stacked up where they can get it down using magic. The mori are a family of predominantly reds, and are known to have particularly crinkled horns.
	
**Chunder's Salt**
	This is the cheapest salt-shop in town, and sells salt at 8s/lb, or 6cp/oz. They don't sell in bulk but make a tidy profit off of selling to the poorer locals. Satake, the current shop owner is filling in for Chunder who is on his death bed. Satake, a rather average green, is notable for the polished scales around his hands from working with the salt. He always believes in doing a job well so salt is sold wrapped in carefully folded banana leaves.  He is quite capable of making woven baskets out of the leaves as well, and does so for the larger orders (up to 10lb, the highest order they'll fill at once without notification)
	
**Atasi's Forge**
	The Forgemaster Atasi (the 9th) is a quiet and introverted gold that works tirelessly on iron. She has no small artistic talent, creating great pieces of wrought iron fixtures in her downtime, but her work has room for improvement. Mostly she makes nails, langets, and wrought iron fixtures for various furnishings and doors and sells those at a fair price. 
	
**The Dam**
	The dam that sits at the west end of Gausui Is a massive rock structure shaped by powerful magics. This is where Danzuishan gets its electricity. The massive dam makes up for the inefficient generation practices, and enough generation is made to service those who can afford it. Most people in Danzuishan go without Electricity other than businesses and the rich. The invention of Electric lighting, single-action electric pumps is enough to somewhat reliably power the city downstream

====== Kholirahi_History ======
Created Tuesday 19 June 2018

The Kholirahi as a people begin their story just before the fall of Mana Ulla, thus, this is where we will begin


===== Exodus From Mana Ulla and The Division of Manarahi =====
   Mana ulla was already in a tense climate. Kempalyssar Milat, King of the Manarahi had only taken the throne twenty years previous before he was struck down in 1992 by the wayward magic of his own daughter, Komi  Milat. Komi had become a lich and with her transformation  she took on the profane name Kemalabet Brucheva. She soon fled Mana ulla and left a poltical vacuum that lead to civil unrest. Groups took to the unfamiliar politcal landscape with fervor as well as slow methodical plotting. This unrest was only amplified when a few decades later, the first sign of instability hit. The Manarahi have always been a magical people so when twelve died, seemingly out of nowhere, there was a dangerous panic. Isolated incidents became more frequent. Failing magic items, experiments gone wrong, longstanding enchantments going haywire. The first nail in the coffin really was the abrupt //oversuccess //of many experiments, where the results were uncontrollable but otherwise flawless. Slowly, Mana Ulla began to fall apart. In nine years, the interim government made the choice to leave, via caravan, to follow the path that the Manarahi ascetics would travel to get to their monastery on Mohara. The Exodus took place that year and the majority of the citizens left. 

   It is not hard to imagine why people would stay in Mana Ulla. The magical access was second to no other accessible place on the plane, the fish was fine and most things died in the approach to Mana Ulla, giving it the natural defences it very much enjoyed. The people who stayed were the ones who laughed at the government's decision to leave. It is worth noting that these people were three things. Full of hubris, idealism, and importantly, power. Most of the people who stayed behind were mages who could count on their power to at least lessen the impact of the magical instabilities. This cultural resonance among those who stayed would shape the Kholirahi to what they would become. Hubris, Idealism, and of course, powerful. In the year 2081, nearly a century after the death of the last king, a large surge of mana swept through the leylines at roughly the same time and caused an automanaclasm, a natural wild magic surge. The Automanaclasm overloaded every magical item and device in the area, and it is only by the grace of Aralc the Archfey of Eyes, that anyone survived the resulting elemental storms. She grabbed the remainder of the Manarahi at Mana Ulla and rushed them into the feywild. It would take Approximately thirty years before the Manaclasm would quiet down, the longest and largest in history. The Manarahi were dropped off on the great grass road and decided to travel northward, over the aegis to another, smaller leyline node. Their passing left many small towns in their wake, including some they have gone out of their way to conquer since. 

===== The Journey North =====
   The travellers, yet fresh from their harrowing experience would have stayed in the great grass road if it were not for the problem that is Broomb's Band. The hag has been alive longer than many creatures ever will and her band of orcs has essentially always been where it is. Being hunted and harried from the hillocks in the south forced them northward. The south side of the aegis proved too easy for monsters to hide in and the north side brought tremendous rainfall, moving north along the Ushlubarel proved promising and in fact, after disposing of the beholder that had  been there for quite a long time, they settled in the ruins of the Sunstorm crown in 2299 and were rather peaceful for this time, a prosperous span of almost two hundred years. They started trade with the Dwarves in Skalmirthon and used it to build the fortress that would eventually become blackwater as well has spreading into the woods around. When the year of darkness descended in 2492, they were safe within the walls. Their magic powerful enough to drive the creatures back until 2493. Exhausted and tired, they found themselves facing illithids and their foul ilk. Nothing gets the gate open faster than mind control. The citadel fell quickly and those that survived, again, only the most tenacious and powerful. The Manarahi now considered this a retelling of events, and connected with their history in poetic ways, this is when the idea of Kholi particularly struck a chord with them. They fled north again, until a mountain  just south of the Ualakomara range Which they named Alabethara (or Alabetara, the H was never pronounced.) Which translates to Death Mountain in Manar. The fleeing Manarahi were commited to their death and considered it a cosmic coda in their poem. It would be seven years of constant fighting, against lesser problems before one druid, whose name was not recorded, managed to connect with the Severed roots of the world tree. These roots worked well as a focus and were importantly, still living. It fed still on the emotions of those nearby, and unable to deliver those nutrients to its host, they built up quite a store which was being fed on by lesser fey. The druid and the other mages took these plants and combined them with their bodies, clearing their minds and giving them power. Men were found to attune the best and thus, to fight the encroaching monsters, men were preferentially raised to females. It was for necessity and it was what kept them alive throughout the worst of the onslaught. They were able to live once more. Alabethara became their home

===== The Orcs =====
   To the north in the rather inhospitable Ualakomara valley, In the year 2575 what we can only assume was a damn good banishment ritual caused tens of thousands of orcs to suddenly appear. They quickly established themselves in the area and called it "The valley of war."
   These orcs fought amongst themselves enough but frequently they would venture out to attack the other settlements, even reaching as far south as Konia and Skalmirthon. The elves of Ilfea used their mythals to keep them out but the Manarahi of Alabethara relied on their magic. They were tired and fed up of running. They became more or less what they are today. Militaristic, cold, and driven. The theme of these people seems to constantly ring out as hubris. They turned themselves into soldiers who served their commanders and kept the army at bay, ever perfecting their Mysterious power. One thousand and nine hundred years later to the day, the Manarahi had finally beaten back the orcs, separated their armies and enslaved the entire population. Atstiwa Cugan, the commander of the armies, stood on top of ualakomara and announced that they were now taking their place, that their music still played and that they were now the Kholirahi. The people of poetry, irony, and injustice.

Kholirahi troops consist of some very different loadouts and to understand their military, you must also understand the absolute power that is the god-king in their eyes

=== Slave Contingents ===
	The God-king does not have the time nor patience to turn everyone to his vision, thus, the kholira trade in slaves and raid frequently to maintain their numbers. These slaves are armed with Spears and shields, and told the god king does not wish their deaths. Despite their servitude, this motion of faith can easily cause the captives to continue their servitude without question. These are sent in under the command of the Orcish tribes described below. They order themselves in ranks and have minimal training, 


=== Orcish Warriors ===
	Kholira was founded on top of what had previously been the largest orc settlement on the continent, the valley of war. The Early Kholirahi people, so proficient in magic all utterly outclassed the orc's best warlords. They kept them as slaves. First to gather resources from the harsh land, then to attack their enemies. As Kholira grew, the Orcs became battlion leaders. They enjoyed this elevation, as their god, gruumsh demanded that the orcs be warriors. They will never be able to rise above their oppressors so they take their aggression out on the enemies of those masters. They drive great war engines and are the first after the slave contingents to join the fight, well armored, well armed, and well trained. They organize in rank and file and prefer using spears and pikes to other weapons.


=== Rudmages ===
	The Kholirahi citizenry are all Rudmages. Named for the tree roots under their skin, whose magic they draw on. They will often sweep into an area using groups covered with Pass Without Trace to cover their infiltration. Some will hide under the earth or stone with Meld into Stone, and others will set up snares. They excel in drawing out their enemies and beating them to death with their Shillelaghs
		**Nirrum's note: **//It's pronounced Shill-ey-lee, I blame the halflings for the spelling//
	Most importantly, the basic rudmage is there to get rid of defences. With spells such as heat metal and dispel magic, they can easily overwhelm most defences so the soldiers can get it. 


=== Elite Rudmages ===
	The Kholirahi elite, those who have all but mastered the use of the magic under their skin, are one in fifty of the kholirahi. They are often sent to keep squadrons together, weilding helpful magic like Healing spirit and greater restoration. They posess powerful magical abilities, using their roots to pull people off of cliffs or to transform them into juggernauts. When these show up, the Kholirahi are usually moving forward.


=== Kholirahi Captains ===
	Leaders of the armies of Kholira, these captains are tactically minded and scrutinous. They usually direct the attacks from afar but are dangerous if approached. 
	
	
The Kholirahi are versed in the ways of war, and exceptional at its execution. Where Manaharamu has won through ingenuity and skalmirthon's position makes it nigh impossible to overtake with a traditional campaign, Kholira has moved forward on the tactics of the godking. The 14th Godking in particular has been noteworthily difficult to divine the tactics of. There is always signs of a pending invasion before it happens, a surge in criminal activity, a few scouts, closed off trade routes, and then the invasion proper. The attacks are usually obvious front-on marches, as the kholirahi excel in breaking seiges and don't need to worry too much about opposing numbers. They are usually weak to hit and run tactics but this has changed with the advent of their own airship fleet.

**The sunstorm crown**
	Wondrous Item, Requires attunement
A medium crown that seems to be made of gold, set in untarnishable copper. It consists of a Band of Copper and gold around a soft leather buff.  From the front and back of the crown protrude 8 peaks, the three front most ones being the tallest. The Central peak contains three small Bright orange gems that seem to glow in any light. The marquise-cut Garnet Spessatines are arranged such that their peaks are arranged in a ray, 30 degrees apart from eachother, the central one pointing up and the other two expertly set so their points orient toward the other two peaks on the crown. The other two peaks are curved, fang-shapes inlayed with  labradorite in small and thin versions of the same shape. The band is set with tungsten studs. The crown seems to be indestructible and will always feel comfortable on the head of a medium-sized creature. The nature of its magic seems to suggest paranoia, or maybe just concern.

**Shame**
	//Dart, Bone Artifact(humerus), Requires attunement//
		  This heavy, 18 inch dart is burdened with the superstitions of the earliest people of the plane. Horrors visited upon lost and confused people in the dark drove them to perform abominable actions. Trapped within this dart is the regrets of the people who performed those actions married with the pain those actions caused. The people of the underdark left this item far down in the depths so they could move on from what they had done, and that is probably for the best.
		   Shame always feels heavier in the hand than it actually is. It is steeped in all of the emotions that drive the shadowfell. Deadening, quiet emotions that drain the life from the person experiencing it. It is a thick Copper spike, mottled with green and turquoise rust. Its barrel is a simple round piece of gold and its shaft is made of bone. The flights are massive white feathers which glisten in sunlight or whenever someone nearby is praying. The dart seems immutable and that is because of the three types of magic that pour from it. The feathers are the feathers of an angel, struck down when it tried to slaughter the people who hid in the underdark, an angel who held onto the idea of blind righteousness. The bone is, unsurprisingly, one of the ones used in the sealing ritual to bind the demon to the plane. It is not perfectly straight but that does not seem to change the dart's arc. The third magic is the magic woven by the dart's sordid history. Time and Time again, coincidence after coincidence, the same dart was used to betray one person in order to save others. Like the angel, every person believed they were doing the right thing, the thing they needed to do to save more people. Nearly every time, the person betrayed would have forgiven them. Nearly every time the bond between the person who was killed and who did the killing was strong. Very few who had to perform such an act were ever able to recover. The strong, mournful and lacrimose magic that settled on this dart grew ever stronger, perfectly arranged, small layers every time over thousands of years. Shame is *just* a magical dart, forged with magefire and wielded by those with strong arms, it has no preference or protections for its use, though the magic upon it makes it very tiring to weild. Any creature that attempts to attune shame must make a DC16 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects a random condition for one day, during which time they are unable to look at the dart, Only the effects of the spells Greater Restoration, Wish, or Calm Emotions can allieviate this effect, as the creature is simply reliving their worst memory, twisted by the magic to be much more painful than it probably was, causing the creature to manifest myriad symptoms, even tapping into magic to do so. 
		   **Random Properties. **Shame has the following random properties:
			3 Minor detrimental properties
			1 Major Detrimental property
			1 Minor Beneficial Property
			2 Major beneficial properties
		   **Ossify. **Shame's magic reaches out, trying desperately to find love and kindness in the creatures it strikes, but that magic carries a heavy burden. A creature struck by Shame must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be petrified as they are encased in and become **bone**. While they are petrified they are fully aware of the world around them to the limits of what their senses would tell them. but are incapable of dying or interacting with the world in any way. Their soul cannot leave their body, they cannot utilize any form of magic (nor can their minds be read), they cannot make any sound or movement. While this creature is petrified this way, their emotions leak back to the creature that struck them, though it is not obvious that the emotions are from another creature. 
		   **Angelic Weapon. **Attacks made with Shame deal an additional 4d8 radiant damage. 
		   **Unavoidable consequence.** When making an an attack with shame, Roll an additional D20 and take the highest result rolled. As a bonus action you can recall Shame, teleporting it to your hand. If you are separated from shame for more than a day, it reappears nearby you at the end of your next long rest. 
		   **Regret.** A creature that has attuned to this dart and killed or petrified at least one creature with it cannot achieve an afterlife until the dart is destroyed or that creature released from petrification. It remains bound as an incorporeal and deeply mournful spirit, unable to do anything but feel emotional pain from what it has done. This creature may manifest as a ghost-like image  but is unhelpful and nearly impossible to communicate with.
		   **Destroying Shame. **It doesn't take much to destroy shame ostensibly, though it is difficult. A creatue that is attuned to Shame may attempt to reconcile all of the guilt that binds the magic together. A single DC 10 Wisdom saving throw, a single DC16 Constitution save, and a Single  DC 23 Charisma save is enough to weave the attuned creature's spirit with the will of the creatures previously attuned to Shame and accept the grief, and let go of the past. However, the unwinding magic destroys the person entirely, body, mind, and soul irretrievably, erasing them from existance. A creature cannot benefit from magic to make these saving throws, and any such magic on the creature is dispelled in the process.
		
**Firebow**
	Shortbow, Rare, Requires attunement.
		As a bonus action, you speak this bow's command word and ignite it. Attacks made with the bow now do an additional 1d4 fire damage. The bow and any ammunition fired from it emit bright light for 10ft and dim light for an additional 10ft for 1 minute. This effect ends if you end it as an action, or after ten minutes. The bow regains this ability daily at midnight.
		
**Gurglethong**
	Sling, uncommon
		Dipping this sling in water causes a bullet made of ice to form in the pouch. This bullet remains the temperature of the water it came from and becomes liquid again after one minute. 
		
**Sweet Potater**
	//Battleaxe, Very rare, Requires attunement//
		You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you may curse the target for the next minute. During that time, you can use a bonus action to pull the creature up to 30ft toward you.

**Mountain Sweeper**
	//Flail, rare, Requires attunement//
	When you hit a melee attack with this flail, the opponent must make a strength save against your attack roll or be knocked prone

**Annam's Tongue**
	//Glaive, Legendary, Requires Attunement//
		This Woldo's blade appears to be coming out of the mouth of a dragon whose head is cast in some red but not rusted metal. The shaft is black and the blade shows damascened patterns that look like fire. It Requires 20 strength to weild without disadvantage. When attuned to this glaive, your size increases by one category (and this Glaive changes with you, dealing 2d10 instead of 1d10 if you become large), your strength increases by 2 and your maximum increases by 2, this Effect ends if you unattune the item. You have advantage on attacks against dragons and advantage on charisma checks when speaking with giants. 

**Tabar of Prowess**
	//Greataxe, Very rare, Requires attunement by a barbarian//
		You cannot be surprised. Once a day when you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to enter a rage. This weapon can do either bludgeoning or slashing damage and it grants you a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

**Soul Sword**
	//Greatsword, Cursed Artifact, Requires attunement//	
		This abomination is a nearly triangular piece of metal nearly six feet long. the end of its wide edge extends to cover part of the guard. Other than the edge and tip, the rest of this sword is covered in a fleshy mass, veins, and a single eye near the point of balance. To make matters worse, it is sentient, and insinuated that it is the origin of ambition. On Snarl, the Soul Swords and their tales seem to pop up eternally, and at least six nearly identical swords are known to exist, though there are records of one of them having eaten another. The Soul Swords all grant a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
		  **Sapience. **The Soul Swords all have the same Neutral evil personality. They drive their weilder to ambition, personal gain, and not infrequent acts of evil. They have an intelligence of 10, A wisdom of 12, and a charisma of 18. It can see normally in darkness, including magical darkness. Not unlike a moonblade, it communicates in emotions, and occasionally in dreams or visions during trances. It is proficient in Deception and persuasion, with a +3 bonus to those rolls. It makes attempts to persuade its weilder to kill things extremely often, often sneaking in intrusive thoughts about how easy such an act would be, and how powerful the weilder is. You cannot willingly unattune to the soul sword but a remove curse spell works
		   **Personality. **All the Soul sword wants is to eat the souls of mortals and to attain great power. It's got a very one-track mind. It prefers to corrupt its host but people of sufficient willpower can overpower it and force it to their will.

If the sword is ever taken from you, you remain attuned and cursed by the soul sword. You will also always be reminded of what terrible things that sword can do when it is not in your posession, where it is //ostensibly// safe and better cared for.
		   **Shapeshifting. **The Soul sword is capable of changing its shape into any melee weapon, changing to the best fit for the weilder upon attunement.

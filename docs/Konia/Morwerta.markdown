# Morwerta
Created Tuesday 13 November 2018

**After the events of 5854, the Manahararahi Diaspora fills Morwerta with some of the less scrupulous or more business-minded of the Manahararahi, as well as those who want to overcome Racial Tensions. Morwerta begins to build up and regain population. Over time, it will become the spiritual successor of Konia.**

Morwerta is perhaps the biggest remaining bastion of Konian Culture. Its plaster-and-timber garrisonned houses distinct to the human-centric culture it was born from.

====== Monteblanca Region ======
Created Friday 10 May 2019

**In 5854, Skalmirthon begins building military fortifications in the region. The Firbolg do not appreaciate this, and often the Fortifications become overrun with pests and mold, which the firbolg claim innocence on. Despite this, King Deloch empowers the Firbolg, offering them magical tools and armaments in exchange for subverting the Kholirahi forces. If this region continues undisturbed for more than 20 years, it's likely that this backfires and the Firbolg Re-establish Monteblanca as a country.**

The Monteblanca ruins are the barely visible remnants of the Firbolg druid-empire that once spanned the western aegis mountains from 3142 to 3291. Some firbolg still live in the area practicing ancient druid arts that produce extremely robust creatures. Never again will they rise into an empire... probably

The firbolg in this region are also quite varied in their appearance, owing to their multiple origins. To the north, they are more humanoid, to the south they are more animalistic, having features reminiscent of goats and similar creatures, such as longer ears or lateral pupils. 


==== Shelter ====
	The Firbolg of Monteblanca take shelter in Dry-stone Brochs, consisting of two floors usually, accounting for the height of the occupants. The first floor contains  their tools (iron and steel from skalmirthon), their food stores, and some of their animals. The Animals they domesticate varies wildly from broch to broch, as each Firbolg house has its own agenda.


==== Fashion ====
	Taking cue from the humans, the firbolg here mostly wear simple plant-fibre shirts and pants, sometimes kilts, depending on how they feel.
	

==== Food ====
	The Firbolg eat quite a wide diet. The more artistically talented will eat a variety of vegetables and occasionally meats from their groves. Their cuisine is undeveloped in terms of recipes and technique, but they can make a wide varieties of stirfries, stews, soups, and simple platters. They often trade for salt and oats
	

==== Fighting ====
	The Firbolg that live on the ruins are not wont to fight, but if forced to defend themselves, they reveal that they have not lost all of the druidic arts that once held up their empire. Each Druid uses mold earth and spider climb to stealthily excavate pits in the foliage behind them as they move, making it difficult to follow them. If they are far enough away, they call to other druids to burn the area with the invaders inside it, as they are exceptionally capable of rebuilding. 
	

==== Culture ====
	Monteblanca, as a region, is known for small groves centered around brochs. Each one is different and the tending and cultivating of the land will reap different benefits. The druids mostly follow Chauntea and Silvanus Equally. The artistically talented ones can achieve a balance of the land that they can benefit from while also being as low-key as possible.

====== The_Bone_Artifacts ======
Created Wednesday 24 October 2018

Car'Teruna, commonly called Teruna, is a Demon. The Abyssal status is questionable, the effect of Teruna's Tenacity far Dwarfs that of the so called Demonic Princes. This creature drinks death, feeds on the inefficiencies in Necrotic energies and Prevents the inevitable indefinitely. Considering how much food there is for it, there is no wonder as to why it became so powerful. Juiblex would weep at the sheer potency of Teruna's Hunger.  Yeehongu would finish his meal long before Teruna did. The problem is that there is no sweet release under Teruna. There is no insurance of quality of life, and indeed, it seems beneficial to the demon to make most things as //dead as they can be without allowing them to die.  //The ideator of Snarl, Nek Uiji, had seen entire worlds razed to unfortunate goo by the work of Car'Teruna 

To Break Teruna, a Gargantuan three-stage ritual needed to take place. First, The World-seal needed to be built. Copied and appropriately modified from other successful prisons, the Elliptical Dodecahedract design would prove a successful final pin for Teruna's Power. The Silencing ritual was the easiest part, but the last part, splitting and leaking all of Teruna's power, required outlets. Over a hundred and seventy artifacts, each the piece of a deceased creature, specially chosen for the task, were used to spread out Teruna's Power and unfocus it. These were originally held on stone caged shrines around the continent, but over time they got lost. 

It is not known exactly when the Cult of Teruna arose, but They have succeeded in breaking at least One (**2851a: Two, 2854s:Three**) of the bone artifacts and are studying others in an attempt to Free Teruna. In the Meantime, each one of the Artifacts holds some Nifty benefits and extreme powers. Many of them have undergone crafting and shaping to become something useful, and while this weakens the artifact as a whole, the chips that come off are mundane and useless.

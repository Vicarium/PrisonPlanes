Cosmology of the Prison planes

1) The individual planes
	1) The world of the Killer- Panopticon with Witsend
	2) The World of the Death drinker - Teruna/Car'Teruna (**looks as a Wasp or stirge with sixteen eyes, a large stinger, twelve clawed legs, an abdomen that appears to have two large holes in it such that it resembles a strange forearm, and a vaguely humanoid skull, though this is only one depiction**) 
	3) The World of the Future Eaters - Kythera
	4) The world of the Time Eater
	5) The world of the Dream Corrupter
	sadness eater
	
2) The Satellites
	1) Allabar, Opener of the Way, Moon
		who knows what Allabar wants? We just know that it hates
		Allabar is constantly chased by Hirokira, with varying levels of success. It has attacks and stats and very much dislikes the living. Killing allabar is impossible as it is, though sending it away is easy enough.

	2) Hirokira, The burning Devourer, Sun
		Hirokira eats all that falls in its path, It burns brightly by eating the lost souls that fly too high above the prison planes. It particularly seems to enjoy centaurs
		It chases Allabar across the sky of each prison plane, timed so that each one of them can have a predictable day-night cycle

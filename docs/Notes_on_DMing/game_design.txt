Movement should feel uninterruptable and with enough skill, should be exactly that
you honestly shouldn't notice that you're playing a game
LEvel flow should be simple, 
Unconver next chapter if you use a hubworld
Lower numbers
**SLOW, ULTRA BAD**
**INERTIA GOOD**
Need reward for filler mechanics
Telegraph upcoming challenges
Enemies should always have purpose and be compelling
LEvels should be linked by mechanics more than theme
openness vs focus. Open world vs rails. 
USe open as hub, rails as spoke
**Cutscenes are wait time. Only for exposition. GIve it a timer**
Rewards should be rewarding 
Figure out what is the most rewarding reward and what its value is.
when the level changes or a new area is revealed. of the player says "I did that" then you've done well
No getting kicked out of the level after obtaining an objective.
**don't stop a player from making their own fun**
* Make movement sweet
* make environment sweet
* Let'em loose
Sound Design
BIG IMPACT 
Realistic =/=Immersive
The difference between reality and your in-game representation of it is a representation of how you interpret the world. 
Directions and goals matter
Environmental immersion vs mechanics

**If I can forget the controller, then it's a good day**
sweet flow state
	High difficulty & low skill is anxiety
	High skill and low difficulty is boredome
	Fuse the two

really, players want a seamless flow between their information and their ability to react to it

See but can't access
players need to think that if they look somewhere they'll be rewarded for their effort

If you go with a skill tree, make it a build, make it so that choices matter



Hubworlds serve as a training ground, teaching basic concepts as **Part of the tutorial**
Communicate themes and story elements 
*repeated central theme of the story* ala chorus
hubworld keeps people playing by providing low-stakes pacing
HALO WAS REALLY GOOD AT PACING compared with toom 2016
have things to do in the hub world
change the hub to change the tone *recontextualizing ideas and opinions*
Conceptual foundation
Emulsification showcase

==== Balance ====
Balance between luck and skill for audience

==== vs BAd sequels ====
big empty worlds, too little over too much
doesn't know what game it is
	see "design by subtraction"

NON(Unique and interesting NPCs)

=== Bad design choice ===
Test and see how **little** 


PUT NOTES ON MAP

==== Level design and story ====

Set dressing Environmental storytelling. 
Staging player-space with environmentla properties that can be interpreted as a meaningful whole, furthing the narrative of the game
Requires a level of deductive reasoning
	Archaeological skills
		determine relationships
		cause-and effect
		history
	Makes the person an active participant in the narrative instead of passive
	doesn't get in the way of gameplay
overheard conversations
item descriptions
scans, notes, emails
animations 
graffiti

usually describes what happened before you got there, sometimes describes how you have effected the world

can be used for tutorial or mechanic hints


Sets also matter.
	Level design
	Architecture, layout, materials, scale,
	Opulence, verticality (metaphor, poor under rich)
 believable spaces allow people to intuit procedure
	necessary things like bedrooms bathrooms, lore stuff
	Maybe difficult, might not make sense.
	
Overall setting of the world, worldbuilding, lore
	timeline, factions, history, 
	
Every level of representation should be referring to the same thing
Make sure teams come together to make sure vision is shared

setting can be used to create emotion (such as caves or crevices causing feelings of pressure)
	Very much analogous to art design and composition. 
	Colors make a massive difference
	
Emotion charts and intensity charts
	Emotion charts
		Break a level down into sections (based on events or progress)
		determine the theme for each secion
		Match the theme with the intended emotion
		Use environment design to evoke those emotions
		"In the ____ you should feel___ so your senses reveal____"
	Has to gel with the game mechanics. Darkness for horror might be scary or safe in stealth games
	
	"____ evokes___ by making you ____"
	Intensity charts
		find desired intensity levels per section (as above) 	Hoping for low in story, high in combat
		Check against playtesters
		Perhaps use tradition story structures
		
Journey is an excellent example of environment storytelling


For stealth public and privated spaces
separated from vague rules to strict rules (societal expectations)

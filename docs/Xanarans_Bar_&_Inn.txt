====== Xanaran's_Bar_&_Inn ======
Created Tuesday 23 October 2018

"//What? You've Never Been to a Xanaran's?"//

	 Xanaran's Bar and Inn is a chain of taverns, onced owned by a Red Dragonborn named Xanaran, who's portrait is behind every bar. The establishment has gotten so popular that its prices are the best reflection of local economy. It has comfortable beds, bog-standard pricing, and the same menu every time. **Curiously, the barkeep appears to be a dwarf. The Same dwarf every time. ** //Barstomun Strongbeard// is a level 4 Fighter (Battle master, with Manuevering, Menacing and Disarming) with the Tavern Brawler feat, and claims to be a war veteran from off plane. He stands at 4'3, with coppery-blonde hair braded neatly  behind his head. His beard is well oiled and bound in brown leather strips.
	Barstomun is a friendly person who //Always// willing to spread gossip. He will always be helpful but responsible. He is always willing to haggle if payment is offered up front and tends to overlook minor discretions, though he frowns heavily on theft and will call the guards on thieves, rapists (whom he despises the most), and anyone who attacks another in his establishment. He always has a good idea of the NPCs in the area and what their uses are and if possible, uses local ingredients in his dishes, going so far as to pay a local farmer to grow his preferred crops and raise the preferred herds of animals.

	The Xanaran's will always use Dark stained wood for its floors, bar, chairs, tables, and shelves. It will also always have a minty green wallpaper. Metal fittings are always brass and the designated gaming tables all have cup holders and are bolted to the floor. A Xanaran's should always feel familiar and comfortable with a decent selection.

* Each Xanaran's seems to have a different version of barstomun, They do not share memories between them
* Getting Barstomun to leave the Xanaran's ends up with A New barstomun running the bar, with the memories of the old barstomun up until he left the bar
* There can only ever be one barstomun in one place at one time, one of them will always leave view beforehand or disappear Mysteriously at the earliest opportunity. Frequently, the one that left the bar originally becomes the permanent one. If a Barstomun returns to its original bar, the memories of the two instances of barstomun fuse seemlessly. Barstomun does not notice this change. 
* Killing Barstomun only results in a replacement showing up to report the murder, the fresh corpse changes slightly for each viewer individually at any moment their attention slips. A bounty of 100g is put up on the perpetrator if they escape justice. 
	* Casting any spell other than revifify that would bring the dead dwarf to life brings back a dwarf who is in personality, identical to barstomun strongbeard but with a gruffer voice and an obsession with whiskey, wine, and Cognac, which he will not shut up about.
		* He claims his name is Tungdil halfleg, a reference to a mining incident where some very sturdy looking granite was hiding a fault and a substantial amount of conglomerate. He was unharmed by the subsequent cave collapse but was buried up to his knees. Upon his companions checking on him, he claimed to have lost both his legs but he found a promising leg-ore if they'd quit gawking and help him. 
	* Using revivify on the dead dwarf calls forth Barstomun strongbeard who looks frightened for a moment but then coughs violently. Anyone who is not paying attention to the more recent Barstomun at that exact moment will not notice that he looks like the dead dwarf did. Most people's memories naturally re-write themselve so this makes sense, but the players (and thus their characters) always seem to have a knack for noticing something fishy.
		* Anyone who //is// paying attention will always find that someone will always enter the bar and walk to some part of the room in such a way that it obscures their view, their hearing, their smell, and most other senses except for physical touch. People who are in contact with the dwarf that is not being revivified may notice slight changes is muscle mass and whatever feature they're touching. They are then also cursed with a desire to be at a Xanaran's. They are fully capable of leaving and re-entering, going on adventures. But every single version of their ideal future includes a nearby or easily accessible trip to Xanaran's Bar and Inn. This can be removed with any spell that removes curses, such as remove curse, greater restoration, or wish, or the paladin's cleansing touch ability or similar.
* Killing Three Barstomuns will get you banned from all Xanaran's. All Barstomuns become simultaneously hostile and aggresively attempt to force the perpetrator out the bar, Grabbing a Maul and attacking if they do not leave, if any who were uninvolved in the event, Barstomun claims that this person killed his cousin. This happens even if the Barstomuns were killed covertly
* Killing more than that invokes the wrath of multiple gods of multiple alignments in full.
* If a player goes to court after killing barstomun, barstomun presents the body of a similar looking dwarf as evidence. To even the finest inspection, this dwarf was the one that was killed by the perpetrator.
* Barstomun is never surprised that people know his name, he has served a great many people and can't remember all of their faces
* Barstomun is for all intents and purposes, a normal NPC with no special resistances or abilities outside of his class and race. 
* Bartsomun seems to be responsible for the opening and closing of Xanaran's, and can occasionally be found on a caravan heading out to a new location saying he left "Maggie" behind to tend the bar. No one has ever witnessed anyone by the name of Maggie running a Xanaran's anywhere
* Barstomun will never acknowledge the existence of another Barstomun
* His answer to any question about these inconsistencies will be  "You'll have to ask the boss, They're down in ___ Right now", Using a different town or location each time and on occasion will use "They're off-plane right now." 
* No one has ever been able to corroborate any instance or appearance of "the boss." Save those who claim to have seen them. None of the stories about the Boss' description match eachother.
* Bartsomun's "stew" recipe will always be the Recipe of the nearest Xanaran's
* **The rule is that there is always a Bartsomun Strongbeard, There is never not a barstomun Strongbeard, Barstomun is Entirely oblivious to this and has no interest in looking into it. Barstomun will always disbelieve evidence by trying to find holes in it, he will often call people troublemakers and stop talking to them but won't go out of his way to kick them out unless they get aggressive.**
* Other Patrons who have seen this before will frequently stop exchanges from going on too long "Yes we all know it's like that, we don't know why"


==== Trivia ====
* The University of Manaharamu once attempted to discover Bartsomun's secret and the experiments that ensued lead to sixty seven deaths and a pact between Ioun and The university to "//Fuck right off" // in exchange for //"Not bringing about the end of your precious daycare," //Shagati Furnace has claimed this to be one of the most well understood contracts ever written, although it was long before his time.
* Nirrum the Mad claims to know the secret and claims that "telling you would just make things worse," Usually followed by "I have to go"

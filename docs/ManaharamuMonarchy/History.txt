====== History ======
Created Thursday 12 July 2018

//The history of the Manahararahi is probably the most significant out of those histories on the plane. On other planes, such rivalries of importance are marked by firsts and victories in war. But on a plane where the population began from other civilizations and other peoples, different aspects of culture are to be measured. Much of the technology here was brought in, and even when other planes forgot it, we remembered. The Manarahi are the source of this plane's heart, they sit as the jewel on the crown of its overwhelming magical field. There is still so much for us to learn, but of the civilizations on this plane, we are surely the most beloved//

===== Early History =====

==== Exodus from the Darkness ====
	   About five hundred years before the Manarahi emerged, they were already a family. Over the past few centuries, they made their identity, made a language, and learned how to survive in the darkness. In this time, drow were indispensable. So cut off from their god beneath layers of woven gold, the insanity that lolth wove upon them was undone, and out of fear of the dark, they joined with the other creatures. Their Eyesight pierced the dark and guided the people from the monsters that dwelt therein. They ran out into the dark, bravely and fiercely feeding their new kin, who in turn worked in frenzied panic to maintain the stability they managed to achieve. Water untainted, Warmth unlimited by cloth. It is here the story of the Manahararahi truly begins. Wizards and sorcerers were the only things that could access magic here. Those who were born with it, and those who studied it. In the Darkness before the emergence, it was certainly magic that saved those early people. The light cantrip will always be sung about in manar hymns, ones even the Kholirahi remember. The magic that ended nightmares, exposing their truth to all. From light, writing remained, and from those  writings we can begin to piece together hat happened. The people of the underdark had been running from mind-flayers. In those abysses, such creatures flourished. They had moved upward, into the cold layer, where waters ran criss-cross through the cavescape. The Manar had no furs to keep themselves warm and were generally ill-suited to living in such a frigid place. Wherever the water emerged, it tended to freeze as the pressure was lifted from it. Here, we get the Manar word for Death. Alabet was not their first exposure to death for certain, but it was their truest knowing of it before attaining it themselves. Ressurrection was a thing unknown to the people of the underdark, and death was more final in those days. The illithids were ill-suited to the cold themselves, but sent other things to harry the freezing tribe. These things were unfortunately the doom of the illithids and indirectly the salvation of the people, for their presence was enough to alert purple worms. The tunneling monsters shot upward toward the creatures, as detailed in the Rising Poem, and broke the surface. The starlight that filtered down was first described by a child, Tarn Ravora, to be the light of at least a hundred wizards, we will never let him live that down. With the Surface broached, the power of gods came back.  Arman and Liura, twin clerics of pelor were flown up by wizards. Recent refugees, not even speaking Manar, they mimed their desire to be on the surface, away from the stone that hampered them. They were the first to step foot on the new world. But the prayer of Pelor's children travels far. Filled with his gifts once more, they proved what they were. In our measure, they were clerics of the twentieth level, and their god knew them by name and face and desire and deed. They spoke with Pelor. "Come, lord of life. Save our family."
	   Touched by the light of the wandering Hirokira, a sun enough for prayer, the clerics felt his warmth soon flow.
	
	   The first day of a new life. The illithids ascended closely, feeling this flux in the magical fields. Liura spoke to them in their language when they set foot under the stars, ready to continue their feast, "I have great pity for the cursed stone upon which you stand." 
	   Tarn attests that Pelor appears human, that his skin was the color of mud and his clothes matched. His hair was that of the sun and his voice was smokey and deep.  Pelor appeared and undid the illithids, casting their foulness in all capacity into the obscurity of background magic. The surface was mostly flat, deserted, and not much more welcoming than the caves. Pelor blessed these people, clothed and fed them and gave them water to drink from before turning to his new task. Leaving a powerful light behind, he sought the largest source of power on this plane. The Great White Tree Treysa had felt the god's presence. On her land, a great plane on the southern shore, they met, and with her were the other founders. Nek Uiji, a storm giant, beloved of Anam; Gramot, an Azer and crafter without peer; Thenagarurokamon, a Bronze Dragon with secret magic; Duparatham Ka, a Dao with great resources;  and the unspoken Necromancer, who we have since divined was named "David". Each played many parts in the creation of the plane and they all sat at a table underneath the great tree when Pelor Greeted them. Through a day of discussion, Pelor was allowed to use the Tree's roots to spread his magic across the land, spreading plants that love the sun across it. Hirokira was less reliable in those days but for now, it held in the sky. Pelor Called for Shashelas, god of the sea, and asked him to look at what was an extremely hostile ocean. His mere presence spawned life in all of the rivers that flowed and across the sea, bolstering what there already was in the ocean and forcing ecosystems to flourish. Sea elves travelled to the shore, bolstered by their patron's presence and offered to serve. He gave them one tenet. To do what they could to save the creatures of the land that fell into the waters, to bring them ashore, do otherwise as is proper of elves. and it is an oath they have kept.
	

==== Corruption ====
	   A single year was all the first people had to enjoy their new land, and they didn't spread far. Two clerics brought Silvanus and Melora into the plane the same way. They said the people were too irreverent for the dangers of the wilds, as they were absent. Too greedy would they become. 
	   //I am not one to speak ill of gods, but I do not agree with Silvanus and Melora. Civilization was here first, and my people had undergone centuries in darkness and fear. They corrupted the land, spreading dangerous creatures, inedible and poisonous plants. Worse. They were followed.// 
	   Orcus is a demon god of silence, he wishes stillness on things that move and will move things that should remain still to achieve this. **Orcus followed Melora and Silvanus and shattered the plane**. The breaking of the plane saw the death of over seventy other civilizations that were close to the surface that we have found. This was a Catastrophe for the planar Creators, and for the Manarahi it was a fresh apocalypse. A single year after their escape from darkness, they had known the corruption that gods can bring, and now, two years past and their world was ending. Another poem, faehkurth, speaks of the roots of the tree and how she protected the freshly founded settlement of tepet. The Manarahi were eclipsed by darkness once more but this time, they could hear their gods. The breaking of the plane sundered the network of gold and the magic that lay on it, and now, even underground the Clerics, Paladins, and druids of other domains could work their wonders.  The Manarahi flooded into the underdark as the continent tipped from the cataclysm, This time to bring people to the surface. This time, they acted with their full power, chasing the monsters of the deep back into their caves, sending a magical tide of hope to all those trapped deep underneath them.
	

==== Resurfacing ====
	  When the floodwaters receded and the tree let down her roots, the people of Tepet  had expanded downward into the caves once more but this time, they held firmly against the surface, their magic a bulwark against poor mining mistakes or breeched tunnels, Families held onto their own magical traditions and made all manner of magical craft and minor artifice. Snarl was the last Plane to place its magic on Allabar, an the ritual set to guide it around the prison planes was the work of nearly a century of interplanar planning, bolstered and headed largely by the then-young tagic corporation on a neighboring plane. In This time, one of the bone artifacts was found and its importance made known to the Tepet Council. They decided to take on the challenge, to make a lethal and suitable home for the item, trapping it in the lair of their greatest work. 
		**Elder Dramuut**
			"It's a mountain" Elder Dramuut. The Sandstone god, the immortal machine, The apotheosis of cruelty that the ascendants of the Manarahi would manage until the first Manaharamu-Konia war, Two thousand and twenty years later. Purposely there was not much written or recorded about Elder Dramuut short of what few adventurers managed to squeeze out of its chambers. 
			//Nirrum's note: this thing killed me once. It is not worth pursuing, there are easier ways to obtain immortality and there is nothing that I can think of  that could be Dramuut that is worth the effort. I will say no more.//
	Within the span of a human's life, the people of Tepet found their first and most treasured contact. The Lelumadil dwarves who had set up on the newly formed Aegis Mountains. Only once in these people's histories would they ever go to war, if it can even be called a war. For now though, the Dwarves made contact with the mixed peoples of Tepet and saw their works and Called them "The magic people" which Gave the Manarahi their name. The dwarves were prone to experiencing bouts of magic, creating artifacts with higher frequency than other races, but without the ages of pedagogy that the Manarahi had, they would only ever have breif and disconnected works. The adventurous blood of the people on this plane had paid off. 


==== Journey to Mana Ulla ====
	The Manarahi have always valued magic, and so when early Dowsers managed to map out the most likely leyline vectors, they found a node where two leylines with acute orientation was positioned and, surprisingly, it was a short journey up the coast. It would take the Manarahi less than five years to move their entire civilization northward. The area was pushing into the Kavir-e Namak desert but had a natural spring, whose water bolstered the Manarahi's magic. Living in the area was not without its issues, Dragons were beginning to meet the plane more and more frequently due to the Pterry-Gaiman effect in combination with a few Astral pathways that had been opened by enterprising mages. The dragons preferred thearea that Mana Ulla was in and that is what got the gulf it's name, the Dragon Coast. The Manarahi responded with a very quick set of Dragonslaying weapons, Including the famed "Annam's Tongue" Glaive (which resides now in the Manaharamu Museum and the works of Tafa Piprek, famed blacksmith.

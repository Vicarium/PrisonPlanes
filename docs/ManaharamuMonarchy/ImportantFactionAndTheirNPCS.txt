===== Parliment =====
The Manahararahi courts and law are dictated by the parliment, on the grounds that a single person will always make a mistake, no matter how wise. Thus, the Manahararahi elected five representatives to debate and create the law, with seven lawyers to interpret the law to the grand jury, a public forum, as well as back to the representatives. These incumbents can all be uprooted with a public vote
	
	//Representatives//

He keeps things neat and focuses on regimented, controlled growth and does not handle unexpected things well. The only planar non-native member of the council of representatives.

He has done one year of every starter course for mages in Manaharamu, and has a deep understanding of the fundamentals of magic, but a lack of conviction (or maybe ADD) made it hard for him to progress. His Penchant for pedantics got him the position of Representative, which he has kept for a long time, having gotten it by speaking out in the Jury when he wasn't trying to find a job. He walks with a staff made of Yucca. He has no major political goals outside of equality

He wears a Dark Blue Thoub and a silver crown, a gift from the royal family almost two thousand years ago. His brother, Jharkes Ravora died 70 years ago, yet remains the acting admiral of the Stockwood Pirates.
			**Tarn's Fate is entirely unknown. It is likely that he died during the siege but no amount of magic seems to be able to locate his body or spirit on any known plane of existence.**

			
	//Lawyers//
		Lor Demimu (ISTJ)
			A Human who is zealous in the interpretation of case law. 
			Height: 5'10
			Weight: 175

			Height: 5'10
			Weight: 150
			Age: 108

It is clear she has the Manahararahi -and indeed the world's- best interests at heart because of pitfalls that she has managed to forsee. She carries a lacquered yew wand tucked into her ear. None of her spells are damaging except Magic Missile. She wears a pale green Thoub with a crown of white teak,  
			**Died During the siege**
		
		Blisslok Duatsa (cleric, Knowledge 2) (ENTP)
			A halfling cleric of Avandra, and a Capitious pedant who finds fault and flaw in everything. They are an exceptional lawyer for this reason
			Height: 3'3
			Weight: 47		
			Age: 111
			Blisslok is one of those people that cannot allow a sentence to go without caveat. They are hard to talk to and hard to convince but exceptionally useful at finding loopholes or repairing other loopholes. It takes a lot more time to fix a loophole they've found than to fix someone else's loophole. As a lawyer Blisslok has a great talent for abstracting the law into understandable words. They wear a Salmon-colored Button-down coat  With Avandra's symbol on the sleeves. The coat is enchanted to be perpetually comfortable
			**If the party reaches Manaharamu after the spring of 5853, Blisslok has been found murdered and a new replacement is being looked for**

		Par Dal'tar (ISTJ) 
			A half-elf  who relentlessly pursues the word of law.
			Height: 6'
			Weight: 200
			Age: 70
			Par believes in the absolute interpretation of the law in the form of the written word. Half of the words in the Kodal Manahararahi put into place in the last twenty years have been Penned by his hand, usually in combination with Blisslok. University Scholars have even drafted up treatises on the impossibility of true interpretation, inevitabilities of corruption, and the use of language as a tool, all to be presented to stop the slow mad crawl that Dal'tar believes is the true way. They have all been decidedly ignored, and the only success  university scholars have had was giving Par a magic pen that produces words that seem mundane until viewed with magic for translation, at which point over seventy languages with a minimum of two dialects per language are able to reproduce the **intent** of the law as if it were written. Manaharamu's case law studies have become significantly easier when read in non-native high elvish by other lawyers.
			**Murdered shortly after the siege in Grand Tortuga in an attempt to establish Manahararahi law.**
			
		Uktu Sosojuki (Swords Bard 11?)(ENTP)
			A green shardmind who has more stories to tell than anyone has ever seen written.

			Uktu wears a black robe, buttoned at the collar and cut to accomodate his facets and protrusions. He carries two swords on him at all times, one short sword and one longsword. Uktu is the most recent addition to the lawyers, as this is his first year. He brings otherworldly insight to the interpretation of manaharamu Law, and with his charisma, is able to deliver unpopular edicts in a way that is well recieved. He is non-native (as all shardmind are) and refuses to say how old he is. Some say that there isn't an answer, Most divination magic does not work on him either.
			**Left for another plane, it is uncertain which one**

		Kemanli Dakalo (Rogue Scout 3)(ISTJ)
			A Silver Dragonborn who keeps all changes in mind, and sees conflict before it begins
			Height: 6'7
			Weight: 280
			Age: 50
			Kemanli, it seems, was born to be a lawyer. She wears a white Cheongsam embroidered with Vined Trout in green, the symbol of the Danzuishanese maze hunters,  a group she was a part of for three years in her late teens. She found herself capable enough of the work but eventually found herself wanting stability. She has an adamantine knife that is dangling in its sheath from her neck. She studied the law of Manaharamu (where she was born) after she found a small fortune in the great maze, and made note of many legal conflicts. She brought up 172 of such conflicts in the law and was Immediately given the seventh seat of lawyers, as the previous one had died that morning on mysterious circumstances.
			**Returned to Danzuishan, works as a Maze hunter and attempts to prop up the lives of the dispersed Manahararahi**


===== Military =====
	Manaharamu's Military is comprised of 20 thousand rank-and-file soldiers. All trained and mostly deployed throughout the Manaharamu protectorate. They have Five Hundred Zepplins at their disposal, Twelve apparati of Kwalish, Two hundred Camels, Two hundred horses. Manarahi soldiers have initiate training in magic for the most part with only a few exceptions. There are a great many of these soldiers that are full casters, warlocks, or Hybrids. Rangers and Paladins of pelor are exceedingly common, riding their own mounts and weilding their own magic.
	
	Lord General **Tenkitagan Dal Trussari **(Fighter 20 Battlemaster)(ENTJ)
		A cutthroat half-elf who makes every situation his own
		Height: 5'9
		Weight: 173
		Age: 47
		Tenkitagan Dal Trussari is considered by his opponents to be heartless. For this reason he has very few opponents. He has short copper hair and his face is covered in several long straight scars, marring his gruff face. He wears his White Trussari garb without its helmet and a bright orange coat of plates. He weilds a finely crafted Vicious Adamantine flail, and he goes out of his way to break things with it, particularly armor and vehicles. He does not have time to deal with small problems as in the life of a lord general, one is always at war. He is also the leader of the Trussari, having come from their ranks first.
		**In Hiding with the rest of the Trussari**
		
		Themesong: Mazidon's Fury - ParagonX9
		
	Saint General Hazut Mohi (Paladin 14 devotion)(ESTJ)
		A skeleton who couldn't care less about lost flesh
		Height: 5'1
		Weight: 22
		Age: 312
		Hazut Mohi was so restless in his service to Manaharamu that when he died to an army of Yugoloths and //then defeated them to the last, //he was immediately promoted, sainted, and given a mastercraft Hobgoblin Nagamaki. His loyalty to the crown is unquestionable and provably unfaltering. He now commands the Manarahi First Legion, First Cavalry, and First Aerial. A Batch of 1500 infantry, One hundred Mounted units (many paladins themselves), and one hundred airships. 
		**After Freeing the rest of his legion from service, Hazut Mohi and a few like him that refused to die in the Siege of Manaharamu now scour the world looking for the next heir to the Manahararahi. **
		
	General Omshavor Tabetgan (Ranger 17 Hunter)(INTJ)
		An eladrin who fights monsters and does so from the sky
		Height: 5'11
		Weight: 189
		Age: 460
		Who else could have been so fitting for the leader of the aerial forces? Omshavor Tabetgan is a dragonslayer, and an archer whose golden summer skin describes her perpetual anger and rage at the enemies of the Manahararahi. She wears a mithral shirt that is polished to a mirror sheen. If she flies at dawn or dusk, her position will allow her to capture the last rays of the sun and make her shine like a star. She often stands on the extended gangplank of her airship and Rains her arrows down from extreme height upon her enemy. She particularly enjoys hunting monsters and harassing dragons. She commands the second and third aerial aswell as the second cavalry and second legion
		**Died during the siege, body was recovered and found to be in the winter form for the first time in over one hundred years, She was laid to rest on the slopes near the circle of the mountain by a few survivors nearly a month after the events**
	
	General Taparmish Milat (Rogue 10 Inquisitve/Barbarian 6 Ancestral)(INTP)
		A human who Excels at reading people, though perhaps he has help
		Height: 6'0
		Weight: 232
		Age: 42
		Taparmish is, interestingly Dyslexic, which isn't much of an issue when he wears the glasses that fix that, but because of this quirk, he has spent most of his time watching people. When it came to the military, it was his ancestors that pushed him through training, but his mind that carried him to higher ranks. He uses an elvish sabre which he swings viciously and carries a shield with the crest of Manarahamu on it. He dresses in Standard White Military fatigues but wears no armor and frequently paints his face in black and white to look fierce. He commands the Third cavalry, Third  and fourth legion, and the First Armored, consisting of the Apparati of Kwalish 
	**Brought his legions to the service of King Deloch of skalmirthon. Much of this army likely is stationed on the northern slopes of the Aegis**

	As of the spring of 2583, Kotsi becomes the university's archamge. Before that, he is the General of the Fifth Legion and Fifth aerial, though this was largely a formality as he mostly just commanded the University's war mages under the direction of Moin Matur, who selected him for the position. He has never been in or seen conflict in a leadership capacity and his poisiton was a formal nod to the Univserity's power. He has personally witnessed conflict under this title and dealt with the matter personally. **As of late 2583:**
	**Kotsi Kemadumana'ab (Wizard 20)(ENTJ)**
		**A Methuselah whose hundred skeletal arms have written seven thousand scrolls and whose sixteen eyes see much more than light**
		**Height: 7'2**
		**Age:42**
		**Weight: 210**
	**Kotsi Ascended as the archmage in the autumn of 2582 succeeding the recently deceased Moin Matur, after the other candidate for Archmage had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. He is a master of the wizardly arts, floats slightly above the ground, and seems to command otherworldly magic. He wears a pleated black skirt and leaves his pallid and nearly skeletal torso uncovered.  He only has a small fringe of copper hair, as his Sixteen eyes march well up onto his rather long forehead. His two dominant arms remain coated in a thin layer of flesh and skin, but the 98 others erupt from his back in a disc shape of two layers (though anyone who actually counts might notice that two are absent, Kotsi doesn't actually have legs and simply has another set of extremely long arms attached to his pelvis). He floats slightly above the ground but not enough to reconcile his height**
	
	**As of the events of 5854, Kotsi Is vehemently against the actions of the Changeling cult and seeks to sever or usurp the Power of Teruna. He does not blame himself for being absent during the siege of Manaharamu and does not particularly care to rejoin their society, but is furious at the treachery of the Cult Members.**

[[+Trussari]]


===== Criminal Underworld =====
	The Criminal Underworld in Manaharamu is divided into five main factions, The Furi, The Macleodquin, Kobetgan,  Pipiratsi, and Nnepruwa.
	

==== Nnepruwa ====
**Reestablished in their entirety in Skalmirthon**
	An enigmatic group of high-tier criminals that focus on embezzelment and blackmail. They are hard to actually pin any crime on, as any hands-on work is often contracted out to the other gangs. Their most powerful members are listed here, the rest tend to be Arcane Tricksters with proficiency with a Forgery kit.
	
	//To Join: //__The initiation rite for Nnepruwa involves __


	**Kohipinrolo** **Milat (Wizard 9 Divination)(INFJ)**
		A Strange human with an eye that glows gold if he is conscious.
		Height: 5'10
		Age: 46
		Weight: 155
	Kohipinrolo exists as an organizer for incoming crime. He simply tells people where to go to find things. He makes an effort of knowing things and uses scrying to figure out the most important things. He wears a white shirt, white gloves, a red vest, green pants and black shoes. He has pale skin and salt-and-pepper hair held back in short ponytail and small gold pince-nez glasses. He is quiet and will never get in the way of other criminals, and seems to be always ready with the information they need. Even assassins who have come to kill him have left with ways to improve or information on more important targets. The few that want to kill him anyway usually run amok  of the other members of Nnepruwa beforehand.
	
	**Nekao** **Nwalo (Barbarian 7 Berserker, Cleric 3 war)(ITSP)**
		A twitchy goliath who stands as sentinel to the business
		Height: 6'7
		Age: 27
		Weight: 230
	Nekao is to Kohipinrolo what a meteor is to clay. Roughly the same thing at his core but in an entirely different form. Where one allows the world to shape him and shapes it casually, the other takes matters into their own hands and makes a mess doing so. Nekao is often kept inside the headquarters of Nnepruwa for the purposes of ending assassins. He has a magic spear that returns when thrown and a net mimic that he has trained to not attack him. The mimic will attack whatever creature it is thrown at and if it misses, it will still attempt to make its pseudopod attack before returning to Nekao.
	
	**Gorgy Oglok (Ranger 11 Monster Slayer, Wizard 5 Abjuration)**
		A well armed dwarf that has a way of dealing with wizards
		Height: 5'3
		Age: 60
		Weight: 260
	Gorgy Does not like wizards, He carries a longsword and several daggers coated with venom, all alarmed if someone were to try and grab them. He uses his spell slots exclusively for counterspell and dispel magic. He wears leather armor and has his sandy hair cut short and his beard trimmed close.
	
	

==== Pipiratsi ====
	A gang of lowlife scum that robs travellers and scams the less intelligent. Their existence is perpetuated by only their numbers. A lot of Thieves, a few barbarians.  **Subsumed by the furi**

	**Kemwomshalo Kemulyssab (Arcane Trickster 5)**
		Manaharamu's most wanted Halfling. No one is sure why he hasn't been caught yet
		Hieght: 3'9
		Age: 38
		Weight: 100
	Kemwomshalo runs his gangs of thieves simply. They give him a cut of their spoils and he doesn't screw with them. He rarely wears the same thing twice and has a habit of coloring his hair differently. When he is seen, he is usually wearing a collar
		**DM's Note: **//It's a collar that functions as a ring of Mind shielding and was stolen from Yma of the college of whispers//
	

==== Kobetgan ====
	Lowlife scum? Minor Cultists of some malevolent star? This is the edgier version of Pipiratsi. One will frequently see their members involved in assassination. Many of them Are monks of the way of shadow, a few of them Shadow Sorcerers. **Dissolved**
	*
	**Kobetgan Dal Bliss (Warlock 6 GoO)**
		Masquerading either as a half-orc, a mess of shadows, or a kind elderly elf man, this Methuselah/Star Spawn seeks destruction against the manarahi, unbeknownst to the forces that hunt them
		The physical stats do not particularly matter, though their age is some three thousand
	Kobetgan usually means nightmare, or refers to certain mental illnesses, and Translates to "thought monster". Poetically, it has been used to refer to a foul idea as well as the person who had it. Kobetgan was born of a foul  star who was angered by the Manarahi in times long ago. This Creature was sent to subvert their works but found them to be far more tenacious. They work to increase their warlock powers to usher their master's power in to the plane, but it has been slow going.
	
	
 

==== Macleodquin Pirates ====
	Quietly operating out of the North East Quarter using airship docks in north west or running caravans through south gate, The MacLeodquins peddle the raw materials and trade goods that their counterparts on grand tortuga have looted from their pirate raids. They spend this gain on gear for their ships to fight in their pirate war, as well as to sell. Antoine, the leader of the small group here in Manaharamu is often in the company of several Turtle Rogues and Turtle Sailors. They keep their heads low but frequently get into spats with the Furi. **Recalled to Grand Tortuga under the direction of the Pirate King**
	
	**Antoine Welles (Artificer 14)(INTJ)**
			A  Master Artificer and businessdrow who aims to make a difference in the world by spreading technology. 
			Height: 5'1
			Age: 278
			Weight: 130
		Antoine is an irregular addition to the MacLeodquin pirates. He met Angle in their shared time at the university. They bonded as Turtle-Natives and Antoine decided to support his efforts to end the pirate war as well as use Angle to spread the wonders of Artificery that the university concocted. He is not entirely sinless, but he is convinced that what he is doing is for the best. Dressed in a Dark Blue Peacoat (despite the weather) and slender black pants, Antoine is often seen around the tower of Trade late at night with a straight and slender staff capped with a lense which functions as a set of "Eyes of Minute Seeing" (DMG p.168)

			

==== Furi ====
	The Furi are a threat in Manaharamu, a true and terrifying threat. They supply almost all of the illicit drugs, contraband weapons and materials, and so many of the most devious lawyers. The Furi is usually behind the actions of Kobetgan, Nnepruwa, and Pipiratsi, often giving them targets, information, and supplies to carry out what would benefit them mutually. It is in this Indirect Manner that the Furi has been able to keep a hold in a city that violently opposes it. Gino is often in the company of many Furi Footmen, Furi Mobsters, and on Occasion, a Furi Psion. 
	**Most of these people survived and infiltrated other societies**
	
	**Gasageno "Gino" Targaran (Bard 15 Whispers)(ENFP)**
		 A tiefling with bright eyes and a wide smile.
		Height: 5'9
		Age: 22
		Weight: 164
	Gasageno is one of the furi's Inner family, a distant cousin to Orsithach himself, and one of the More cheery of the family. She only heads out at night and wears a Tie-Dye T-shirt and large britches. She plays a double-bass when she can but also plays a mandolin when she's out and about. She is the head of the Furi's Operations here in Manaharamu, despite being an all-round swell gal. She has **no **issues in destroying government property or destroying lives, but despite this, She goes out of her way to make sure people don't **die** in the process unless they get in her way. Once someone crosses this boundary, she takes great glee in orchestrating terrible and catastrophic deaths.
	**Active in Danzuishan**


===== The Guard =====
	Of course a city like Manaharamu has people to deal with the unruly, the unlawful, and the uncultured. The Manaharamu guard is a highly trained and sophisticated part of Manaharamu's social system. Guards swear an oath to the queen and to the gods of civilization and undertake ranger courses at the university of Manaharamu, allowing them to become great trackers, Problem solvers, and subduers. Guards tend to organize in groups of four for any particular activity other than patrol, where they pair off, using loud Whistles to call in other nearby officers.

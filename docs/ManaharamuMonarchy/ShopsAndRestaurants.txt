	1)**Aleeg Dalkwatsi**
		An expensive and exotic food place with only the finest of chefs. The least expensive meal costs 100g, the most expensive, 3000g.
			The Menu isn't traditional, you do not select a meal, but you tell them what you can and cannot eat, what things you do and do not like, and they prepare a custom meal from scratch. A Divining wizard uses detect thoughts to make sure that there are no miscommunications in what one says and what one wants. Dishes are not standardized but they often conjure rare ingredients that they do not have. Doing so triples the price of the dish.
				**Dm's Note:** Ask your players to describe, to the best of their ability, the perfect dish for their character, and then say the spices make it better than that.
			**Damaged structure, the staff that remained free and survived set up shop in Skalmirthon doing much the same thing**
	2)**Xanaran's Bar and Inn**
		You'll never guess who runs this. This particular Xanaran's is Massive, due to familiarity, it is always filled with foreigners. It is the largest inn in town and has over Two hundred rooms, though filling up isn't uncommon. The Top building is the bar itself, while the rooms are underground, stretching past the thin layer of sandy clay and into the roots of Mohara, where it is consistently cool.

====== Nirrums madness ======
Created Thursday 10 January 2019

Nirrum is missing part of his memories but set up contingencies beforehand to replace them. One such contingency is the fabled temporal wavepool, which is arguably one of his worst-designed spells. 

Every six seconds, the events of each bracket of six seconds that occured since the start of the spell repeats,  cumulatively, until Nirrum ends the spell or three minutes ends, whichever happens first, and the spell continues even if nirrum goes unconscious. If someone attacks something in a space, that same thing will happen again six seconds later, slowly filling the room with chaos. Nirrum's first spell thereafter is always healing spirit.

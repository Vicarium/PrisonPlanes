**As of 5854, the end of the Great Pirate war, King Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux sits undisputed at the head of the Government. During the events of the fall of Manaharamu, He shepherds a massive chunk of the Manahararahi to safety in Grand Tortuga, However, the people of Grand tortuga are not well suited to the culture of the Manahararahi. The Turtle natives are nearly universally more powerful than the Manahararahi civilians. Life as a Manahararahi in Grand Tortuga is fairly Miserable. They are frequently robbed and assaulted with little action from the king, Who is frustrated with the state of the island as it is. Rather quickly, Evisern Iyrelm begins ferrying people to the Sanity Islands and Danzuishan. **

**The Sanity Islands are the territory of Elementally-attuned wolves and two kingdoms of fey, The Previously named North kingdom is now the southern-North Fairies. By Nature of being more south than the southern fairies of Manaharamu, now known as the Northern-south fairies. Neither of these kingdoms should be confused with the  Western Fairies of the West gannaga, who are currently the northernmost faction, except perhaps the enigmatic eastern fairies, who may or may not exist. Understanding this, Most of the Manahararahi decided to not settle on the sanity islands**

DM's Notes:
	Consequences are harsh on Grand Tortuga, functionally everyone is a violent criminal. Locks are frequently trapped, People are suspicious. Because of this, and the nature of Humanity, Grand Tortuga has reached an equilibrium. Part of the point of this module is that because of this equilibrium, people have gotten complacent and lack goals. Most of the Leaders aren't even trying for the treasure at the heart of the island, really, a fact which is entirely and completely hidden from the players and should remain so, only becoming apparent as you go through the module. 
	
	When I ran through this module for the first time, one of the players ignored the main plot entirely and decided to take over the island. This lead the plot in a completely different direction then, as you will see, I had planned. I obliged, after all, a DM does not tell a story, they tell the news, and In the month and a half span of in game time that the players were in Grand Tortuga, It was an eventful newsweek, involving alliances and an absolute steamroll of the island's equilibrium by the simple nature that **none** of the captains were actually prepared for it.
	
	


Run down to the plot section now.
	
History	
	Once a prosperous trading outpost, grand tortuga has been long overrun wiþ pirates, cutþroats, and unscrupulous traders for over a þousand years. While þere isn't a governing body, þere are groups and families þat one would do best to not cross. Þe city almost mirrors Kara'ite, as many orphans are taken up by þe more powerful groups to keep up þeir numbers. Turtle Culture is often friendly despite being reclusive. Visitors aren't welcome into homes, Bodies are never found, but bumping into someone in þe street is met wiþ smiles, 'excuse-me's, and apologies. Þe people live in perpetual politeness wiþ þe understanding þat þe arrogant are never seen again. Grand Tortuga hosts is own breeds of warrior, wiþ adept assassins, subtle mages, and creatively insane warlocks who have made pacts wiþ þe deep. Þe town is lined wiþ stormpiercers and modified versions þereof. Þe town understandably has þe finest fried seafood, as well as almost every trade good known to man. Þe Town is obviously not wiþout danger, quite þe opposite, a wrong step, a percieved þreat, or þe wrong word uttered can end wiþ disaster.

	The Pirate raids began when two crews began to fight over a chest that both laid claim to. They brought in their allies, called in favors and loaded up on weapons. Choosing to tell a bunch of other pirates that you found treasure might be seen as a bad idea in retrospect. Grand Tortuga has never been the same since.  The first was the Avisen, who buried the chest. The second were the Fugin who found it. The avisen brought in the Rockwallers and the Hatain. The Fugin followed up with the Jaquy and the Klas. The Klas brought in the Kveter. The Kveter brought in the Bal'Jasar. After 600 years had passed, the DurFisher Formed from the dregs of the island's denizens. The Rockwallers Called in a favour and brought in the Murtucks, Who were followed by the Decidente. The Decidente called in the Furi. After 1800 years since the beginning of the the fighting, the Bruchev show up. The last Two to join where the Barry who came by accident, and the stockwood twice. Once the barry came, the Kveter and Klas families merged, having been allies the entire time. The Stockwood host the youngest seat on the council, at 78 years present, That is, other than the Tibeaux who showed up two weeks ago and killed the Jaquy. The MacLeodquin are technically the oldest family on Grand Tortuga, having been the Original inhabitants, and prey to the Avisen.

Urban: Tiered Port Town.
Humid: Heavy cloþes will cause exhaustion checks
Occasional Heavy Precipitation (lightly obscured, extinguish open fires)
Battlefields might be crowded wiþ civilians

Food can only be bought from food places þat match its price. 
Þere is an increased risk of an assassination attempt and a cheaper restaurant

Þe only freshwater sources are from solar stills and rain collection. 




On Turtle Culture

	The residents of Grand Tortuga are known as "turtles" colloquially. Though it is worth Noting that very few of them are **tortles.** No race is a majority but humans make the largest chunk **Until 5854**

	Grand Tortguga is of course made exclusively out of tenuous alliances, a few fools, and an overwhelming feeling that a knife in the back is inevitable. 
	Pirates from one faction may mistake members of an allied faction as having their back if something goes down but this is far from the truth. Alliance here largely means "Doesn't fuck with much," so thinking that you're safe around an allied clan puts you square

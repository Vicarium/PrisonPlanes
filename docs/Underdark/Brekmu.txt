====== Brekmu ======
Created Thursday 20 February 2020

Brekmu, Rocktown, the city of gnomes. Most of gnomekind can find a home here, provided they are cordial to their fellows. Brekmu is a city built for gnomes, by gnomes. It contains great secrets and powerful workings that most of the plane is entirely oblivious to, as per Gnomish tradition.

**A preface on gnomes.**
	It's no surprise that there is little mention of gnomes around the plane, A few merchants, a few wandering traders, but nothing substantial. Where other races have been cut off from their gods, their magic, their homes when they reached this plane, the gnomes were //unlocked.// The magic of this world resonates with the gnomes more than any other race, to them, it's //their// magic. It is intuitive despite its esoteric nature. For this, the gnomes (a majority of them anyway) are **the only race who are capable of shedding the magic of the plane without issue. **On top of this, the gnomes claim that **Thenagarurokamon, **one of the creators of the plane, employed the gnomes and claimed that their workings were his own doing, both protecting them and claiming quite a large amount of treasure in the process. There is no evidence for their claim and less evidence for the contrary, as it is undeniably clear that the gnomes are fully aware of the plane's magic and capabilities. Few races are so united in their behaviour as the gnomes, to the point that it is fairly scary to think about what it is that they're doing. They also have mechs, that's pretty neat.
	

===== Description =====
	Brekmu was first built in 166 as a response to the cataclysm. It is a fine work of the gnomes, containing intricacies that seem to casually sit at the level of the best elven crafters. Stone carved to look like water, great semicircular parks in shallow domes filled with statues that look real, Machines that //exist// as part of the very structures. When a gnome wants something, their world shudders and shimmers as machines efficiently move to convey things. Overlapping brass, steel, titanium, and aluminum, all coloured, gemmed, stylized as their creator whimmed all serve a million functions. The dreams of power that seep into the mind of every teenager are the lives of the gnomes of brekmu. Their home bends to serve them. If you blink, they have disappeared. If you attack, you are held back by the walls, the floor, the low cielings, by magically sustained  bonsai, by hidden mechanisms everywhere. The Gnomes don't even need to flinch when there is an attack. They are in control. Thankfully they know what to do with it.
	
	Brekmu is only accessible from one angle, through one passage. The Passage is hidden by perfectly shaped rocks that hide masterful illusions. Tunnelling through the rock would take eons, and you can't exactly come at it from the other side. Brekmu is pressed up against the very edge of the plane. Contained within the exponential wall of time-dialated, energy-stretching foreverness. It glows white, blue, and pink with the magic it consumes, magic the plane funnels from the nearby regions of space, magic generated by the creation of millions of multiverses every second. Jumping into this wall sees a body disintegrate over the course of millenia, though it seems instant to the people experiencing it (though it is millenia relative to us, much to the dismay of a test subject who was promised a full ressurection). This colorful light fills their view, their entire world pressed up against the edge of a dimensional edge, pinched near the ever narrowing vertex that pins Teruna to the fabric of the far realm's sturdy and strange existence, trapping the entity in a masterfully woven spell of recursive time, massive thaumatic fields, and a dearth of feedback as its own power is leeched away through the bone artifacts. The Gnomes say that you can follow the path down to it if you'd like. There's a few miles of jade, silver and gold between you and it, so good luck bringing enough picks. This is a trick, they will very much attempt to kill you if you try. They have never failed.
	
	The town was named in Manar, its essence is a coverup. The town is made of secrets, and those secrets keep the plane together.
	

===== Urban, Economy, and Society =====

	Brekmu is best imagined as a town built clinging underneath a cliff. Its rooms and roads get smaller as you head downward. Each one is carved into the rock and offers a stunning view of their "sky".  Wide parks  contain wild life of small surface beasts, plants, and microbes. Each park is itself a petri dish, a carefully watched and controlled environment that serves both as Data and Augury, as well as the gnome-holes of the forest gnomes who find the path down. Hidden Underneath a well-shaped rock, a pond, a tree, hidden in the vines that might hang from the ceiling, hidden in the 40ft hidden green pit that some of these parks actually //are//, there is likely a gnome. Watching, waiting, hearing the pulse of water through roots and taking careful measure of the thickness of shells. Their neighbours are always tinkering away, spinning magic through metal, stone, or through magic again. The Gnomes ever funnel their efforts into the repair of the plane as Orcus had broke it, as the cult has sundered it. 
	
	Ceilings here tend to be no more than 5ft high, save in places where a park has gone vertical or a workshop needs room. Doors are never more than 4.3ft high, save those near the entrance which are greater workshops. Oculi in the floor covered by reinforced gates allow larger materials to make their way down to lower levels. A gnome will sleep anywhere that pleases them, which tends to be a single favoured clear shelf near their work. Hallways are small and thin though they do not move far away from the edge of the town that presses up against the wall of the plane. 
	
	Water is shipped in, often using bags of holding. The water that is brought in is recycled heavily. Some of the higher workshops are warded to keep the stench in as some gnomes do their work among the waste of the community which is brought to them by small constructs made as commodes. The waste is rich with information on the health of brekmu, full of volatile compounds and nutrients that some sturdy and studious gnomes can use to culture desirable microbes.

	There are no inns, there are no shops. Brekmu operates more like an impossibly idealized communist democracy. Gnomes that enter the area seem to be taken over by a spell but as far as we can tell it is just their drive to self-actualize taking over in the presence of so many opportunities to experiment and help. Non-gnomes aren't particularly welcome within Brekmu. Anyone who does come is expected to stay out of the way, stay for very little time and be there for a reason. Often deliveries to and from brekmu are done by runners. At the nearest ends of the tunnels to brekmu, there are smaller forest gnome towns that often serve as liasons to the exceptionally few people that know of the town's existence.

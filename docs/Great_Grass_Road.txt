====== The_Great_Grass_Road ======
Created Thursday 24 May 2018

[[+Plot]] 

The great grass road, also known as the steppe, is an area of snarl with relatively low precipitation. The most common thing in this area is obviously grass. Tall grass. This savannah is home to all sorts of ambush predators, Including its people. Horses, Various Antelope and Elk relatives, elephants, rhinoceros axebeaks and many other herd animals consume the grass and some of the more nutritious leaves, and in turn they sustain the terrible monsters. Ankhegs, Gnolls, Griffons in the north, Manticores, Cockatrices, lions, death dogs, hyenas and worse dwell in the grass too, and they are all ambushers. This is also the best place to find camels, Dromedary in the south and bactrian in the north. Manaharamu places the largest claim on this place and supports the Ramishi as its own people, but truthfully, these are simply more wilds.

The great grass road is the source of legends as well. Here, Under an unguarded sky, there are Dragons, Giant Eagles, and Giant Vultures.

**In 5854, The Collapse of Manaharamu leaves the Ramishi without their normal Economic Support, but they are well-adapted for living on these plains. Nneatsumiku has joined them full time, and their druids are now far better trained. The Ramishi Identity is still very tied to the Manahararahi who they now call Manamishi, and their pride as guides has lead many of the otherwise abandonded citizens of the once-great town to safety to the Xia River, Down which they send straw boats to Gannaghi. At Gannaghi people are directed northward to Umlil Orill and Skalmirthon.**

== Ramishi ==
The sapients of this road are not much more helpful than its predators, save the halfling Ramishi people. The Ramishi are camoflage experts, frequently classing ranger and fighter. They make bows of Sinew and horn that are short, but powerful. Their other weapons are often imported from Manaharamu or Danzuishan, which is good, for the advantage that is magical weapons and adamantine is what keeps the Ramishi halflings alive. They are quiet, and do not like strangers, but will always help the lost back to civilization
   Being Nomads, the Ramishi have no set home, and thus, I have not marked it on the map. Very few non-halflings live with them, but there are some. They sleep under small skin tarps or occasionally yurts or under the stars, collect their water from dew, and eat the vegetables and meat that are a staple of this wild plain. They also harvest grain, as this plain was where pelor first stood before the breaking and it is from this that all of the grasses here are wheat, barley, oats and many others, all of which edible, and more importantly, brewable. Combined with wild maize, Halflings use their scouting to gather ingredients for the most famous whisky on the plane. Welchiwelch Whisky takes years to brew and its distillation is a dangerous process. Kept in horns sealed with glue underground, the mixture is left to ferment, the gasses allowed to escape through a small airlock made of deer pelvis and feathers that is designed to capture moisture to keep the airlock sealed. Hidden in the grass and protected by a small cairn of rocks, these caches are only identifiable by the small feathers sticking out of the mound. The mash is left and forgotten at the site of an old camp. For beer, it is drunk when found, but for whiskey it is then distilled in a small Mithral alembic and stored in an old red dragon horn. The dragon horns traditionally were stored out on the plane, buried again to age, but now they are frequently dropped off at Manaharamu for more reliable storage. The ramishi dress themselves in skins and mostly move at dusk and dawn when the heat of the day gets more tolerable. During the day they harvest vegetables near their camp, keeping an eye out for danger. When they are required to fight, they use ambush tactics as well as horseback archery to dispatch their foes.  They are at constant odds with the Orcs and Gnolls that also live on the plains, though the Ramishi have a powerful advantage that often comes to their need, if he's around. Neatsumiku, the honored Archdruid of the Circle of the Grassland, is a Ramishi halfling, and he is powerful enough to deal with just about anything he needs to. I've not been able to figure out why he doesn't just destroy the orcs or gnolls that plague his people. He only has ever said "Mine too" when quizzed on the matter.
Like the drow and Lolth, The halflings on snarl may find it difficult to hear their god, Yondalla. Because of the plane's magic, it is an investment to come here at all, even for gods. Yondalla's luck still reaches the halflings, but not as powerful as it was. Many of them are far less innocent than they are on other, less hostile planes. The Ramishi still maintain strong family ties and still disappear like ghosts in the grass, but they are far more hardy now than their race has ever been.
	**Ramishi Tactics**
The Ramishi make great use of their intelligence over the orcs and gnolls. They frequently bait their enemies into traps and then reverse this trick on the smarter ones, pretending to lure them into places they don't actually want them to go. Outriders pester their enemies from horseback, riding in pairs and staying at maximum range. Enemies who chase the outriders will often find themselves in a Ramishi pit, an ambush consisting of four to twenty Ambushers in a circle and one to eight cutters in the center, hidden under grass. The ambushers pelt their enemies with Stones. When the force in the middle finds themselves surrounded and attempts to deal with their attackers, they find that masters of the sword have begun scything through their ranks with thick-bladed short swords.
	**After 5854, The Ramishi begin to spread out even more. Ramishi settlements begin to pop up all over the plane and they procede to adjust their tactics to new environments. They are still Manarahi and as long as their kin recognize them as long as their kin know what family is, they proclaim they will offer their protection.**


== Broomb's band of orcs ==
Broomb's Band of Orcs is a long-standing threat on the great grass road. One would expect Broomb to be an orc but instead, Broomb is an Annis hag who gifts the orcs potions and spells to protect them. Orc prisoners are often brought to broomb so she can work foul curses on them or corrupt them in some way. Broomb's band of orcs is largely composed of regular orcs, It has several orc war chiefs,  a few eyes of Gruumsh, and several blades of ilneval. Additionally, There is one Tanarukk, Holutang, who lives with the tribe, kept under a spell by the hag. While she lives, it sleeps, a sort of dead-man's switch to keep her power. These orcs raid caravans and small villages along the grass road frequently, often leaving a few stray huts to grow into a village before raiding and destroying them. The orcs, though creatures of destruction, have taken up a ritual over the centuries that seems unique to them. On nights when the moon is not visible (having tricked the sun by hiding around another plane no doubt), the orcs sing to the stars. This star-singing describes their great heroes, their connection to gruumsh and their own smallness. To them, the night sky is a great plane that is a predator far stronger than they are. Their lyrics frequently plead with the sky to stay up until gruumsh comes, when they will be strong enough to fight it. The singing of these orcs is often polyphonic, and a pleasant tenor. They'd have their place here with the college of Glamor if they didn't want to kill everything that wasn't them. Broomb is part of a coven but they meet rarely. A Bheur (vur) hag named Baba lives just on the north side of the aegis near Stalwark and a green hag named Gretchen lives near the swamp that is the primrary source of the Xia river. They have to travel far to convene but when they do, foul things occur.

== Greetu Gnolls ==
Greetu Gnolls are a pack of gnolls that are more of a threat to things on the steppe than orcs. They were the first enemy of the Manarahi who left Mana Ulla. They were the first enemy of the Lelumadil dwarves. They were the first enemy of the Shaat'guun hobgoblins. They are the first enemy of just about anything that sets up on this side of the aegis mountains. Even the Univeristy has stepped in to cull them, and we thought we got them all. We honestly have no idea where they're coming from (//hint: It's //**Yeehongu**//, He's kicking around somewhere//). They are a healthy mix of all forms of gnoll, and the death of just about anything that finds its entrance to the plane to be anywhere south of the aegis. The orcs take great pleasure in defeating them, but more than once have Broomb's warriors been driven to flee to the mountains by the greetu.

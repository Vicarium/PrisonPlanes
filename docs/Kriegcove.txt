**As of the events of 5854, Kriegcove begins to become an important Strategic location for Skalmirthon, Danzuishan, and Kholira who all intend to control it, though Danzuishan does not do much to maintain control and elects to allow skalmirthon to spend their resources in a way that benefits Danzsuishan anyway. **

	A small cove that makes up the only settlement on a large island off the west coast of Varomar. It is a dark place, both figuratively and literally, as the hills that enclose the town are often enough to block the sunglight, and the people have trouble smiling. Kriegcove is poor, dangerous, and unforgiving. It lacks a justice system and guards and is mostly made of the children of exiled criminals, with fresh additions coming in rather frequently. The houses are built poorly, usually in a rush, and frequently on top of each other. The closest thing to government are the gangs which simply kill those they disagree with. 


===== Urban: =====
	Kriegcove's architecture is slapdash, frequently homes are built on top of eachother, accessible from different streets, with little regard for safe building. The Ones that survive the occasional storms are the sturdiest, but they are rarely "structually sound" in a long-term sense. Streets are narrow, usually steep, and simply exposed gravel from years of being trod on. Alleys are frequent. Fishing is the easiest way to live, and secret potato gardens are scattered all around the thick heath or in occasional clearings in the fir, pine, and spruce forest outside of town. Such gardens are kept secret because opportunistic thieves are wont to simply take anything they find //in// town. To its credit, Kriegcove has well-made and well-stocked local smithy, which is the only brick building in town. Sewage is handled in chamberpots washed out under the waterfall or in the ocean. Water is collected in Barrels, tubs, buckets and kettles inside of houses, usually from the waterfall, which looms high on the east side of town.
	

===== Environment =====
	The cold air that blows down from the north frequently blows in rain, drizzle, snow, and fog. The coastal warm current that runs north frequently causes storms just north of Skalmirthon, and these systems end up on the island frequently. The wind is bitter and cuts like a knife. The waters are rich with fish that live off of the abundant nutrients of the two combined currents, and are the real reason for this place to exist for as long as it has, a scant century. The water on the island runs clean, fed by a massive underground spring source that pushes through veins of ancient metals, surprisingly devoid of lead or uranium.  


==== Ecology: ====
	The island is covered in thick forest occasionally interrupted by bog, swamp and sudden shallow rivers, in which the surprisingly diverse denizens of the island thrive. The clean waters give life to mosquitos and midges who feed dragonflies, wasps, and insectivorous beasts. Pine Martens, Wolverines, coyotes, Wyverns, and Stirges are the main bestial predators. Wyverns are the largest of these, with the local variety having serrated barbs on their stingers which they use to whip prey either out of the air or in flyby. The More dangerous creatures that roam the inland portion are describe in the respective areas that they dwell in


===== Economic Notes =====
	* The best place to trade in kriegcove is Danzuishan, which is obviously //not in Kriegcove.// Living here is not a good thing.
	* This place is so backwater it doesn't even have a Xanaran's, What's up with that?

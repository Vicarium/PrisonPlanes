* **Magic:**
	* Thaums are the strength of a magical field, and dictates the potency of magical effects in the area. The average ambient magical intensity in a vaccuum is approximately negative one thaum per cubic meter. The actual number of a vacuum is approximately .003 thaums per cubic meter but this has to do with the inverse square law and the omnipresent magical field that pervades existence. Thaumatic presence will still magical compasses. The negative one comes as a result of Morowal's Thesis, which proves that in an ideal scenario, the density of Mana will surpass the actual capacity of the universe to hold it, forcing the universe to "lose entropy", though there is much heavy and on occasion lethal debate on that part. "A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength. It has been universally established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon or three normal-sized billiard balls."
	* **Mana is the presence of ambient magic**, and has an inverse relationship with thaums. Mana moves out of areas with high Thaums. If it didn't spells would cast explosively. Thaumatic fields are generated by magical effects in correspondence to the mana channelled to cast them.  Think of Thaums as ice hills and Mana as water. Freeze the water and it expands to become a hill, Melt the ice, return the water.  Sufficiently high mana can overwhelm a thaumatic field and cause a chain reaction, sufficiently dense placed thaumatic fields can contain mana which allows for magic to be amplified. Wild Magic sorcerers tend to be people who emit, for some reason, a bowl-shaped thaumatic field, causing magic to go haywire around them. Most   arcane rituals use this, funnelling magic through pre-determined paths in a thaumatic field. The perfection of each ritual is astounding, and to do it properly freeform would be almost certainly suicide. Creatures that can channel large amounts of magic can"test" their circle as they make it, changing it to nearly effortless, Hence spell-level restrictions on rote ritual. Mana has a "positive spin" when measured with a magical compass, and by extension, magical compasses tend to point *away* from the largest sources of acitve magical effects, which would be in large thaumatic fields of low Mana Density. Though the presence of a high Thaumatic field or a High Mana Density does not preclude the other, as seen in rituals.
	* Narrativium Is the total value of magic in a space, measured in pterries. It can be calculated as a function of Thaums, being the maximum ideal magnitude of a thamautic field if it were to perfectly consume all mana in a volume. Rincewind's Formula is the ideal way to calculate the amount of narrativium in an area, which takes the smallest spell at 100% efficiency and multiplies it by its total hypervolume, requiring height, width, length and metaduration of the zone to be measured. This is normally straightforward as the metaduration of most spaces can be calculated by applying Einstein's theory of special relativity, but in the event of the use of spells such as time stop, wish, or just about anything composed by the wizard Mordenkainen, the calculation must factor in the difference in spacetime's own fluctuations and how reality adjusts for that. Narrativium is ultimately a measure of **How much the laws of the universe can be subverted or changed. **//It is intrinsically linked to planck's constant and the subject of the fabric of spacetime. This description of metauniversal law is thought to be at stable equillibrium already, and that sufficient magic can destabilize it.//
	* Residuum is the crystalization of Mana and happens when opposing magical fields try to reverse each other. Residuum interacts as if it were baryonic matter, and seems to mirror electromagnetic forces, allowing it to be touched, held, and carried as if it were dust. Residuum has a half life somehow related to  the (cube root of (twice the intensity of of the thaumatic field Multiplied by the Mana level, divided by c squared)). If I were a physicist, this would be far more in depth.
	* Humes is a measure of the difference between Quantum and Narrativium. Once used on the forgotten world of earth, it is closely tied with rincewind's formula. Narrativium interacts with Quantum, usually by repelling it, thus, humes is a measure of reality, wherein causality is actively predictable and follows clear set laws. There is much philosophical debate about the nature of determinism as opposed to true random, Archbard Nirrum, master of knowledge, lord of words, King of Truth and Lies, and all-round cool guy, poses the idea of metadeterminism. Where Narrativium flaunts what is otherwise universal law and Quantumn adheres by it, one can say that the amount of Narrativium is the ultimate measure of the universe's energy and that Quantum is the measure of its entropic state, that is, what reality does when it is least agitated. Thus, to measure Humes, the best way is to test and see how slow the speed of light in a vacuum is in any given magical field. The slower, the more magical. 
		* It is worth mentioning that there is no known source of or definition of the metauniversal amount of Narrativium, which is to say //no one knows if the paradox of a spell that makes more magic where there was none// even can be resolved. There may be no end to the amount of Looney-toons action we're invited to so strap in for.
		* It is also worth mentioning that the original idea of humes came up when someone, presumably humes themselves said "the more magic there seems to be, the less real everything is".
		* **You can honestly just pick up a Humesian Physics book in my library to get this sort of information though**
	* Snarl's shape is best described as a elliptical dodecahedract, a shape with five spatial dimensions. Looking into Snarl from the outside, you normally would see the surface world as an ellipse from all normally accessible angles. In another projection, it is a dodecahedron with the peculiar aspect of folding in on itself. In another projection it is conoid, and honestly that one is probably the most important, as in the view one would hypothetically be able to see Teruna being pinned by the plane to the fabric of the universe. This awkward shape is unfortunately one of the reasons it's so difficult to actually leave the plane once you're here. A banish spell or similar might work for most newcomers but after being on the plane for too long, options become extremely rare. 
	* Octarine is visible to the attuned through the equivalent of Magical rayleigh scattering. I'm pretty sure I have a ritual here for attuning someone to Octarine here. Y'know. For the Normies.

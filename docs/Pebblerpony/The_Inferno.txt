====== The Inferno ======
Created Saturday 08 February 2020

**An old 4e module I made. The worst sessions I've ever had**

Welcome to Snarl, one of the twin planes. Currently you are in the populus costal town of PEBBLERPONY.
You have been contracted, (and accepted this contract, for whatever reason) by the mayor, Hodney Gardener, to deal with a major Rat issue that's been plaguing the western outskirts of the town, where many of the farms are. Make no mistake, the rats are very large, and have taken up residence in the woods behind the town. 

You begin your journey at the edge of town, having already collected your gear and prepared to embark into the woods. Having bought most of your wares individually, or in some cases crafter, in some cases pillaged; you should probably discuss your course and review eachother's supplies. Be careful though, your spending has left you with only 50 gold to spare.

Skill Challenge
Notice rat droppings Perception DC hard 
half covered by the ridge of a tree root is a singular rat pellet. 
Nature DC med tells you that they leave them as they scurry around to communicate
Intelligence check if you're trained in nature (easy) will allow you to determine the rat came from the north and was heading south

SOUTH 2hr you find the river 

and one rat 

NORTH 4hr you find another river Skill challenge above points west again

The north river dwindles and is fed largely by a spring to the north and a smaller one to the west. A tall bluff looms in front of you regardless of which river you follow inland. 
It is the Nearest of the Aegis mountain's foothills. 

Marking it as your destination from the town makes the trip only 8hrs in. 
Climbing a tall tree (DC easy) and spotting it, then choosing it as your path makes the journey 10 hours. 

Night Falls at 10. The Temperature drops as cold fog fills the valley, unless a fire is lit, everyone begins taking endurance checks (increasing DC by hour) to stay concious.

in the dead of night a banderhobb warder Sets upon the party unless someone on watch or a ritual passes a medium DC to spot it before it can attack. If the party is roused, it retreats into its Shadow realm

Investigating any one of the rat sitings requires a hard nature DC to track


Upon tracking or arbitrarily going to the hill, they find a cave with a bunch of those rats I totally grabbed outside it. A perception check tells them that the rats are just feeding on something else. DEEEEEP in the cave

Dungeoneering, intelligence, or a general knowledge check with a moderate DC will inform you that the rock is, like most rock in the area, Igneous. The cave itself is bored into it rather  than formed naturally like most of the tunnels in the region. This is no dwarven tunnel either, the edges are rough hewn, half-melted. What will you find in there?


the beginning of the cave  is a long narrow tunnel, after 5 sq it's dim light (if it's day outside), after 12 it's dark. A sunrod allows you to see the downward curve that is only 18 sq in.
The curve leads you down a long, fairly straight tunnel. (3hr) which ends in an abruptly large Cavern. You stand on the precipice of a pit that appears to go from the top of the bluff to a deep well of water down below

Perception Mod, History high, nature easy,
The water is quite obviously deep, freshwater from rain. There are no fish in there but leeches and other foul creatures are likely to have moved in. Still they are slow and you may be able to swim to safety if you would fall in
Those who jump in have a 30% chance of catching Greater Otyugh Filth Fever

Those infected by this disease waste away as they alternately suffer chills and hot flashes.

Stage 0: The target recovers from the disease.
Stage 1: While affected by stage 1, the target loses a healing surge.
Stage 2: While affected by stage 2, the target loses a healing surge and takes a -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude, and Reflex.
Stage 3: While affected by stage 3, the target loses all healing surges and cannot regain hit points. The target also takes a -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude, and Reflex.
Check: At the end of each extended rest, the target makes an Endurance check if it is at stage 1 or 2.
12 or lower: The stage of the disease increases by one.
13-18: No Change
19 or higher: The stage of the disease decreases by one.

Those who lower themselves down the 120ft (24sq) or manage to not fall in the water  are safe to discover the beach-like ledge at one side of the pool. There are signs of sapient movement around. Some apple cores (inspect bite reveals some humanoid, definitely not a tiefling, shifter, or vryloka) and a broken waterskin describe someone who had spent a while on the shores here.

It is also worth noting before we begin that I've altered misc checks. Misc checks are something your character is focusing on at the time, using them for roleplaying can get you some pretty fancy rewards, tangible ones that are more valuable than minute boosts to experience. Roleplaying will be rewarded with a single coin flip that you can use on any roll. You can flip the coin and get either +1 or +2 to ANY roll even after I've declared misses or hits. I will be giving them out sparingly, so roleplay strongly and be rewarded in times where you are in great peril.

The entrance to the tunnel is seemingly innocent, but it is dark down here. Cold air brushes up from the tunnel, tainted with light hints of sulphur. A hard religion check can tell you that some powerful force is at work keeping the air mostly clean.

A half an hour later the tunnel suddenly widens. Down the hallway, what sounds like flowing water can be heard. A short distance in  there is a creek. A nature or Dungeoneering check will tell you that it's possible this water was as foul as the prior pond, but a hard DC of either will tell you with certainty that it is clear-flowing springwater. A misc check of Religion will give you a flicker of remembrance to what it reminds you of,  a roll of 18 or higher will tell you that such rivers similarly guard the gates of hell. A double critical will tell you this is the source of the river Acheron.

A whispering devil sidles up to the adventurers. 
"hello there mortal. Care to trade?" he asks. He offers the bargain of anything for the price of howte's soul. 
Upon refusal he presses the matter. Gold? 100gp appears and then disappears. Health? a Red potion of cure diseases does the same. Meat? A full Aurochs slumps to the ground and stays. Friends? He summons the rest of the party. The party fails to disappear. The devil curses. A flurry of wings and fire breifly lights up the cave as two duelling angels rip through the ceiling and straight through the devil. The meat and party members stay.  
A perception check of somewhere between medium and hard without a light and easy WITH a light shows that the angels came from about half a foot deep in the rock, as if they had just appeared there. Their entrance is marked by the dripping of a quickly evaporating liquid and their exit is the same.
 A hard Arcana check will tell anyone who makes it that in theory the reason that no one disappeared afterwards because the summoning channels in the area were likely overburdened by the Angels, making any and all teleportation fail until they had cleared up. 
A second hard Arcana, Intelligence, or History check will tell you that the evaporating liquid is unstable residuum mixed with Methanol, any easy Arcana check can stabilize it. 1000g of residuum can be recovered that way
Any mention of the absence of Nihurath is immediately answered by a stalactite falling into the creek, damming it for a matter of seconds until it finds a way around. A high wisdom check will allow you to hear the words" Maybe they were dreamin'" echo away with the the settling rubble. 
A high Nature Misc Check will make you wonder why there are stalactites in a clearly volcanic cave. A crit nature will tell you that somehow the calcium deposits must be seeping down from something above. 
double crits can tell you that it is the bones of a great many creatures in Mokoi tha'am's region  that got buried by landslides, mudslides and floods over millenia dripping down along a descending fault line to this place.

Reunion is had. Stories are told. Assorted mentions of questing rewards are also mentioned, as this happens the cave is filled with a ghastly stench as 13 decaying skeletons(5,6,10,13,16,20) and a Black Reaver Zombie(ini27). barge into the cave from the lower tunnel enterance that the river is flowing into. 
DRAW
Small cave min 5 sq max 12,  with 2 tunnels, 1sq Creek is difficult terrain or an athetics/acrobatics check to move over, Failure results in prone. Ranged attacks fired from squares closer to the creek's mouth in the wall get +1 for high ground. the crater in the floor is also difficult terrain. The room is, unless someone bothers to light a sunrod or torch, dark.

INITIATIVE: Pick a Partner, and use either of your initiatives to place yourself in the initiative order. You take your Actions at the same time. If you are adjacent to eachother, you may make opportunity attacks as if you occupy your partner's square. Doing so switches the location of you and your partner. If someone is not adjacent or does not have a parter, then as a minor action they can partner with someone until the start OR end of their next turn. Alternately, if one is adjacent to someone who is not their partner, then at any time that the person is adjacent to them they can make a free insight check to temporarily partner with them until the start of either of their turns

Monsters attack wantonly.

TREASURE: the zombie is carrying a very small pouch made of a peculiar leather, it contains 6 gems. A hard dungeoneering will tell you that they are real and quite flawless diamonds. The zombie was apparently sent on an errand. A note occupies where one eyeball should be. It is stylistically hand-penned on vellum, with clearly expensive ink. Why it was crushed into a ball and jammed deep into this zombie's eye is a mystery unless you serve the god ogmha, in which case, ogmha's insight can straight up tell you that the zombie was likely intended to pass through water.
It is in common and a history, streetwise, intelligence, or wisdom check (hard) can determine that it the stationary around the edges is stylistically similar to that of the grand citadel, KONIA's culture.
"Six crates of PI12 to be delivered to Gn.K. I'll send an envoy into the mines. Use a Quieter Wurm this time, I can't constantly explain shaking under our post and no other. -- Bp. O."

The descending tunnel is steeper and the gowing is slower. the water occasionally forms large pools which are ultimately shallow, but tricky to navigate. In one of them, a crushed skeleton can be found on a passive perception that beats the hard DC. A few minutes of excavating rock reveals a bag of holding with this crushed traveller. inside are six sunrods, 12 copper pieces, 3 pieces of journeybread (still good!) and a full adventurer's kit. 
TRAP: Balance with athletics. If someone wants to help, a Dexterity score of a certain height, wisdom check, or any real bit of forethought will stop them from [falling into the water, taking 1d8 damage (5 5 3 1 7.]
1000 xp each.


A medium perception check shows water leaking from the rocks around, feeding the creek
after another half an hour the tunnel widens VASTLY. At this time the water is a knee-deep river but there are banks on either side. A sunrod will illuminate far enough to see that this cavern has many small waterfalls feeding into it from other tunnels high up in the walls. Collections of various rough crystals grow in the dry spots. Notably (medium dungeoneering) Quartz and amethyst.  A hard dungeoneering check will tell you that they seem to be collecting in this tunnel rather than already being part of a vein, precluding the presence of gold in most likelyhood. Hard perception check after this hard dungeoneering check actually reveals 7000gp worth of gold dust that can be collected with a simple 3hrs of panning.

Bone worm descends on the party. Trying to sneak around the light 

DRAW: Really Difficult terrain[] for the now deep river (3sq across) and curving, tiles may exist. Some Stalactites, and some extra rubbly areas,

when the creature is one hit after bloodied, 13 Wraith figments rise from the floor, they are followed by the sound of a Osteopede rushing up along the stony banks of the river(boss battle). 

The party now has time for an extened rest but there is no firewood or food around. Endurance checks of increasing DCs per hour must be made to not succumb to the frigid underground. Bedrolls at a +2 to each roll but are ultimately unequipped for the damp of the cave. Waxing one's sleeping bag can protect against this.Sharing body heat is ultimately the most effective.  Sleep is not necessarily necessary, as it is probably at this point only 11:30am
200xp each

Exploration of the cave can yeild an additional 10k in raw amethyst over the course of three hours, 5k for two hours, and 2k for the a single hour. However, this means you do not get the benefits of an extended rest unless yo rotate with party members.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
The tunnel seems to become a large bored hole again, and the river cuts a path through the middle, the tunnel is short-lived however and a very VERY large cave opens up before the party after another hour of travel. As the travellers approach the tunnel, they begin to hear the droning roar of what sounds like continuously collapsing cave. but the cave floor feels still. The river soon hits a wide, flat plane of slate and the players are all ankle deep in it,  something whitish is constantly falling from the ceiling, increasing in intensity further into the cave, an attempt to catch one, or study the fallen ones before they are swept away reveals that they are large balls of ice. A medium perception check can tell you that they are freezing very high up in the cave. A dim-light vision or dark vision sense coupled with a sunrod will tell you that each drop forms on stalactites above. A high Nature or wisdom check will tell you, for curiosity's sake, that the water has been brought to 4 degrees Centigrade and that due to some sort of air current  above, the water rolls down CURVED stalactites, causing it to slowly freeze and "snowball" at the same time. An examination of the spiral cores of the "cave hail" will also give this impression with a similar check. A hard religion check here can give you a hint of what you are heading into. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter," comes to mind. 




Players must find a way across the battlemat. Sprinkle water from fingers onto battlemat, if a figurine gets hit, an attack is made +9 vs AC. If the Target's reflex is higher, they may choose that defense instead at the penalty of being slowed. Cave goes at beginning of initiative as it is already attacking.
Three Gushing holes occasionally send blasts of water from the back of the cave knocking anyone that gets hit on +8 vs Fort prone in the river. The river does ongoing 2 cold damage (stacking) save ends, clogging the rivers gives you a three turn reprive
(roll initiative every turn)

2000 xp each for crossing

3,8,5,5,8,5,5,5,3,4,5,2,6,6,1,2,5,5,1,5,3,6,4,1,8,1,1,7,8,3,1,8,6,3,7,6,5,4,8,4,8,5,7,6,8,4,3,6,1,5 :|| dmg

At the end of the encounter, the hail gets less dense and turns into water, the ceiling begins to slope back into  the tunnel, if anyone bothers to look back, they'll notice the last of the jagged curved stalactites look like a mouth closing behind them, an ominous and creepy sight.

Another half-hour has passed since last check, the cave begins to warm up considerably. The river that runs beside the party is now a surging current. It's easy to get swept away, so don't fall in, 7sq every full round, 6 sq across, 1d4 damage/round from yet unmelted hail and the cold water. Hard endurance check to save immobilized from shock, Athletics Hard to swim more than 1sq. If a creature has resistance to cold, +2 bonus to rolls for every 5, if the player has more than 15 cold resist, they are unhindered. The Party comes across a cave with 7 fighting Ogres. The ogres are fighting over a Small grey back and are using rocks to crush eachother. If the party waits for 10 rounds, the ogres end up wounding eachother severely, all of them with only 10hp left and one of them with 15. if the party waits 5 rounds, they are all half health. If the party Charges in, the ogres do not focus them. They all focus on getting the (GRAY BAG OF TRICKS)
250xp each, even if they just chill for the full 10 rounds

at the edge of their cave the river pours into a large, thick swamp, lush with vegetation. The bottom of the swamp more than 1 sq out is lined with thick mud.
TRAP
: Sinkholes everywhere. 
Draw: shoreline, Players must find a way across the swamp without getting dragged in under. As they attempt to cross they are assailed by 15 randomly placed abyssal wretches. the abyssal wretches are all slowed. 

The worm-tunnel grows larger and now the river is Very large, 7 sq across and hugging the wall of the tunnel on one side. the rock turns to volcanic glass layered over porous rock and the tunnel starts to smell very foul some areas have collapsed already.  A medium dungeoneering, hard perception or testing the ground reveals it is surpassingly brittle, certain areas cannot be walked on. Falling into one of the pits causes 1d10 fall damage or can be avoided with an acrobatics or athletics medium DC. If the person who falls has steel armor, a drawn steel weapon or a source of open flame or spark, they get SCORCHED with 2d12 fire damage and ongoing 5 save ends. This can also be avoided by walking along the side of the tunnel closest to the river. Steam rises from the river and obscures a single Hill clan Apparition. It jumps out quickly at the party and attempts to do battle.
immediately following the apparition is a steep hill drop. The river tumbles over the edge and into a large walled city. There is a large cloud on the roof of the cave obscuring it entirely. Below, the party can see the river pour  through a walled city and into river of red liquid, constantly boiling. Don't fall in.

10 angelic guards (angels of valor) hover around the edges, They are looking inward. Stealth must beat 19 perception. If  called out to one of the angels will turn around and immediately cry "ESCAPEES"

After the battle with the angels or with a hard religion check (x3) the leader of the Angels, a much more important looking guy descends and makes a vague comment about wasting resources, the will of dead gods. He Faces you, eyes full of fire, nods and walks toward the party. He stops a few feet away and rips out the skeletons of one of the dead angels. He takes the skull, the spine, and two ribs and takes them over to the gate inserting them into a comma-like keyhole.
He ushers you in, wordlessly. A few replacement angels flutter down just as the gate shuts behind you.
A medium religion or streetwise check will tell you that you are unfortunately in the burning city of Dis. Around you the entire city is on fire as a great many creatures of all sorts of races try to avoid perpetual agony.  Endurance check 5 before 3 medium required to stay concious.
Shops are available here but only have about 750 gold each. there are five of them scattered througout the burning city. They will buy the amethyst for half value and the gold for the same, anything else they buy at 10% value. Diplomacy  only will get them to pay full or even 75

Upon inspection (hard nature or Dungeoneering) simply iron and water, but it's very hot, heated by something below. Probably lava.
if someone has the freakin BALLS to swim through the lava, you exit in the newly formed Kingdom of Skalmirthon. 
q

The residents of the town are, for the most part, necromancers, their powers stripped by the Raven Queen herself, others have been 
the risen king
0

banished here by other gods for other reasons. Not much is available in the town itself, too many people pass out from sweltering heat. Some of the houses are nothing more than traps, Charnells and Catlans for the unwitting soul's agony. 
There is no food or drink, people are kept alive by the will of the gods and nothing more, ensuring they suffer before they pass.


The way out of the town smells foul and a med Con check is required to maintain one's gut. If you fail you feel dehydrated. Did any of you bother to take water with you on the way into the town?

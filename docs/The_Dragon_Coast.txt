Created Thursday 20 September 2018

The Dragon Coast is Divided into three areas, East, North, and Drakenhearth 

**DM's note: If sparkles does what I think she will, After an HOUR OF FIRE, she frees BANE, ARCHIVIST OF DAMOSEL. FIRE EVERYWHERE. FIRE FOR DAYS. Bane asks where's the fire. **//"Someone cast enough fire spells with enough consistency that I was able to Unfuck my spirit out of one of the worst planes I have ever heard of."//** He gives sparkles his +2 Cinder Flame Wand (1d8+2 to FIRE, and crits add an additional d10) Keeping his +5 for himself**

===== East, Dragon Savenduku =====
	The shore to the direct south of Manaharamu is the ancient route that the Manarahi took northward after their exodus from Mana Ulla. The magic out here is thick but wobbly and provides easy access to other planes. Of course, Dragons live here. South of the Kavir-e'namak is Dragon Savenduku, or Dragon forest in common. It is populated **Heavily **with Green Dragons. It is Prudent to assume that you are always in range of a Green Dragon's Lair
	* Thickets, 10ft high, 10ft Thick, 1:4 movement, DC 15 dex save or 1d6 piercing. Each 5ft cube has **5 ac and 30hp Vulnerability to fire, Resist B/P, Immune Psychic thunder**
	* There are no signs of the dragons short of running into one of them
	* there is no large game and the small animals all serve as spies to the dragons

	Where it the forest is also coastal, there is frequently war between the bronze dragons that live nearby and the greens in the forest, as well as conflict with the blues and brasses in the north. Bronze Dragons live closer to Manaharamu but still occasionally venture out to raid their Chromatic cousins. That said, the forest is almost entirely Greens of every age.
	
	

	This intensely tropical region is frequently wet, though variations in land elevation make some areas wetter than others.

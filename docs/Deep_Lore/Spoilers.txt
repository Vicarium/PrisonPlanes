Deloch Welch and Lazarus Honore Dorian Tibeaux are first cousins through Deloch's real father and Lazarus' Uncle on his mother's(Kallista's) side:** Orsithach Furi**
Orsithach does not know the fate of his missing son and while he has recovered in the 27 tears since his disappearance, he harbours a desire for vengeance against the child's captors. He does not know these captors are **Harold and Milariel welch.**
**He is catching on that it is likely one of these two sudden kings with a family resemblance, but is only investigating as of 5853.**

Combartch T'ct'tcaeri is one of the highest ranking members of the changeling cult, as are Karagan Barako and Shami Murtuck. 

Yma the quiet was fully aware of the invasion of Manaharamu long before the cult moved. Her eyes are on vengeance against Orsithac Furi alone and used the invasion to advance her own plots

Queen Persephone is now a part of the cult as of 5854, Her daughter rebels and attempts to escape but gets captured and is imprisoned by the cult.

Lagarach Munsa lives after the events of 5853's pirate war, as does Memory Jaquy. Both work for Orsithach Furi who has found Lazarus' father's remains and is working on locating Kallista's, not yet knowing she is his estranged sister. Orsithach intends to ressurrect them to manipulate Lazarus.

Agammemnon, the eater of perfection will eat anyone who gets over a 42 on a check, absorbing them irreparably into his essence. Only one person, Zog Earthshaka (also known as godfather, for his hand in the creation of three celestial beings at this point) has escaped this, and he became the father of a minor Deity: The Runner. This begins a new chapter for the prison planes, the imprisonment of Agammemnon.

The Danzuishanese maze was built using magic in the shape of a brain, and is technically sapient, though it is entirely unaware of the events within the maze or even the physical world. It operates exclusively magically and can be communed with only through the border ethereal near the feywild. It works to keep itself maintained using the magic it sucks in with its void net. It is very simpleminded and doesn't really get communication, words or other creatures. It only understands that it exists and will die if it does not do what it does. Manaharamu has never thought to investigate this angle of magic and would consider it immoral to use it as it is by the danzuishanese if they knew. 

Kemalabet Brucheva is active and occasionally wanders out to produce heirs, the most recent of which is Jennica, who studies in Umlil Orill. This technically makes Jennica and Lazarus first cousins five times removed. 

Acer, the lich of underport is Acererak, a known Canadian and creator of the tombs of Horrors and Annihilation, and he is tremendously outclassed on this plane, whose denizens and magic are uniquely suited against his particular brand of bullshit.

These documents are written mostly by Nirrum the Mad, a Manaharahi native, and is written with his biases intact. The Trade dispute between Skalmirthon and Manaharamu was actually a war started by Manaharamu, among other things. Most of what is written is //true// from some perspective, and Nirrum does not actively attempt to hide the truth. Like everyone else, he simply does not realize when he is ignoring it. 

Kotsi Kemadumana'ab actively rebels against his heritage as one of the bone artifacts but would be powerless if Teruna attempted to take control of him once it was partially free.

Treysa, the world tree, has made a deal with Moseie, the godking. She will assist him achieve his goal if he helps fix the broken prison plane

The prison plane's secondary purpose is to be a sort of "Noah's Ark" for creatures of the multiverses in the event one of the other prison plane's resident denizens ever managed to begin undoing the fabric of the multiverses. Teruna is mostly harmless as eldritch entities go but keeping it in one place is extremely beneficial to the creators of the plane and the multiverse at large. Allowing the creatures to roam free was not part of the intended design, hence the cells in the underdark, but that magic was broken by Razalast Furi himself, almost immediately after the plane's creation. **It's also the reason Orcus attacked it**

The archbards of Manaharamu used illegal magic and their influence to gain their position, not that it matters after 5854

Garhun Ten-cages is the so-called "david" mentioned as one of the creators of the plane and heavily ommitted the truth in designing the ritual to find that person's identity.

**Not even author of this book, Adam Murrin, can tell if Edgar Frottenhammer died during the siege of Manaharamu or if Edgar is actually Fraz Ur'bluu. That's how good he is at illusions. Nirrum the mad certainly has no idea.**

====== The_Raven_Queen ======
Created Saturday 02 June 2018

The Raven Queen has some specific roles to play here on Varomar and Snarl. She was called in by Pelor to deal with Orcus. And Dealt with him she did. In this plane in particular she despises the undead. That said, she is occupied, holding orcus up to his nips in Ice. And because of this, clerics and paladins of her are rare (Only player characters have and will ever be such servants of her, it makes for good flavour)

She does have a tendency to give boons to those she intends to use, wether they like it or not. 

==== Boon of the Raven Queen ====

--------------------
When a creature blessed by the Raven Queen dies, They are instead pulled out of the realm of the dead an into the Fortress of Memories on the shadowfell. There the Raven Queen offers them two jobs. The first, to serve her, and the second is to defeat the Cult of Teruna. If the character picks the former, they gain the Raven's Feast ability. If they pick the latter, then they are given the bell of walking. Both can be chosen and both rewards are granted. If neither is accepted, the character is allowed to die and pass peacefully into the next world.

**Raven's feast: **//When you kill a sapient creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to its constitution score//
**Bell of Walking: **//When Rung, this bell forces shapeshifters to revert to their natural form, as well as to experience extreme discomfort if the shapeshifting is a natural ability of theirs. //

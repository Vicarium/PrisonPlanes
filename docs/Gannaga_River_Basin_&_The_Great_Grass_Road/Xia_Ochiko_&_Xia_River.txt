**As of 5854, Xia Ochiko finds a small boost in population gaining about 200 additional permanent residents in the form of Dispersed Manahararahi. The population boom does not stick much, as Many of the people who stay in Xia Ochiko are elderly and tired of travelling. The Manahararahi Contribute mostly in Magic, as is their way. The People of Xia Ochiko refuse their offer to mechanise their gathering processes to make them easier, but accept firmer defense in the form of stone golems (statted as giant sharks)  that rest on the riverbed with the personality of well-trained guard dogs. Over time, as the older Manahararahi die and the younger ones move on, only a few remain in Xia Ochiko. **

Has trade deal with Umlil orill, dye for tea

Town built mostly on wood platforms spanning small islands. Lots of tall plateaus and mesas in the area (see, china) wiiiide river (wider than most cities). Wilden and shifters make up the majority of the populus. Lots of Fishing, some gold panning, Powered by waterwheels. Battery banks were invented by an artificer from here, Hu Sun, who used his family's wilden magic to prove that with enough energy, spent cells could be reset. 

==== Urban: ====
A road leads from the west bank, down a steep cliff and to a small dock which looks out at the town that sits on the wide river. The crumbly, sandy earth

The town is small, home to less than a thousand individuals in its highest peak, but usually only 400 or so tend to stay. While it is not as small as some hamlets along the Steppe, it pales in comparison to the large cities. The buildings tend to be wood, turned grey by the humidity, though they are often decorated with colored cloth. The water is clean enough to drink from but more importantly there are a few clerics, two of pelor, one of sylvanus, on hand to cure any illnesses and help the wounded. There is no formal government, though council is called when problems need to be addressed. This has worked out well for the most part, though bad and manipulative leaders are common in such a system. They are not particularly isolationist as they profit greatly on trade.

The people wear brightly colored clothing unless they're going on a hunt. Bright oranges and deep lapis blues, sourced from Turmeric in the nearby forest and from the pygmy mud whelks in the river.

The people here are split in their diet. The shifter have quite an omnivorous diet, while the wilden only eat heavily fermented (or rotting) foods. Fish, cider, peach wine and brandy, lettuce, carrot, sweet capsicum, Peanut, sprouts, beans, 


The people sell their dyes, Ivory from elephants and other monsters, as well as some of their spices. Paprika and wild capsicums sold to Manaharamu and Danzuishan are huge resources from the town, for which they get their medicine, their equipment, and their comforts.

There is a temple-shrine to Pelor and Another to Sylvanus on opposite ends of the town. The statue of Pelor is solid gold and places a (Nebulous) foul curse on those who would defile it. It sits underneath a small wooden roof between red-painted beams. Approaching the golden statue against the backdrop of grey and the green of the forest behind it is awe-inspiring. 

The Temple to Sylvanus  sits carved into the sheer cliff face on the south-west side of the town

==== Ecological: ====
The Xia River which feeds into the gannaga is the second longest river on the plane, being outmatched by the ushlubarel by quite a large distance. The fish here include Vined Trout, which are unique to Gannaga, sturgeons, and carp, which spawn aggressively but tend to be eaten by the more monstrous inhabitants of the river.
Froghemoths, Trolls, a few water weirds, wyverns, and indeed hunter sharks dwell here, feeding mostly on the abundant fish

==== Features: ====
Aside from the direct route to Danzuishan, The most notable feature of the area are the "friends" a series of tall dull metallic pillars with holes near the top of them that stand in the river about two miles north of Xia Ochiko, they are notable in the way that there are no birds in the area, and dragons steer clear. Aarakocra, kenku, Kobold, and Dragonborn adventurerers in the area will experience perpetual discomfort, seeming to shift from a bowel sensation, to a sound they hear, to a general feeling of anxiety. This does not seem to affect creatures under the water. There is only creature that can seem to stand these is the rarely Seen dragon, The Golden Eldungandr.

==== Common Adventures ====



An adult black dragon has eaten a house, and the family of the deceased man inside calls for revenge, as well as safety, The dragon lives in a cave upriver where it has hoarded treasure. The dragon has a brood that plays in the river near the friends. The brood is of four wyrmlings and one young black dragon, the last of a previous clutch. The dragon is hostile, and collects standard fare treasure
	The dragon also has a lair. This simple forked cave is only the beginning of it expanding its influence as it slowly tears apart the town of Xia Ochiko.  The dragon sits on its treasure pile and when prompted emerges to trap the party by pulling them into the river. The water is then darkened by the magical darkness of the black dragon. It leaves those who can run to do so after it has taken out a few. It will come for them later, especially if they have already killed its broodlings.

	On the other side of the dragon's cave is a small, dark set of confusing structures, a relic from before the breaking. Amongst the many pillars and sporadic walls, a bodak Awaits. As does a theif. The theif is hiding from the Bodak but will lead it to the party so she can steal their items, which she intends to do anyway, See Volpe Rex

	Use this theif to steal from the party, take their weapons, take their Items.  She obviously heads to Manaharamu to sell them, or Danzuishan, if you have something planned there

====== Rainbow Mountain ======
Created Monday 17 February 2020

The rainbow mountain is a holy site for Silvanus. It is also the roost of the Silver sleeve people. It is named thus because it is a perfectly preserved piece of the original Crust of snarl before the the events of the cataclysm, the year of darkness, and the leyline instabilities of Mana ulla, all of which had strange effects on the geological processes of Continental Snarl.  This mountain is a case of something natural happening to something Artificial. A Jagged plate of Many colours all stacked in neat vertical strata, such that each layer is edge-to-the-sky. Near the base there is sand and clay, uncharacteristic of the region, then the mountain plate itself is Jade, Ceramic, Quartz, and hundreds of different layers of glasses interlocked with layers of refined metals. Gold, Silver, Iron, Lead, Titanium, aluminum. Some layers of the mountain glow at night, both in octarine and visible light. 
	**DM's note: **If a geologist, physicist, and/or engineer or someone more informed than me on this is reading this section (among others in this setting), **and you are DMing, **Feel free to describe the composition of the mountain and some areas more accurately. The westernmost layers of the mountain are intended to be tough and resistant to impact, while the easternmost layers are intended to block, obscure, and interfere with all sorts of conductive energy (including magical, hence the gold and silver). The design of this cross-section of strata is to protect from impacts, mining without explosives, and intrusion from the outside  with little concern for the effects of erosion, while also stopping things from the inside (which lack most resources other than magic) from getting out or communicating with the other side. 

**Radioactive Zone.** One thin strip glows a light green at all times. Humanoids and beasts remaining within one mile of this layer for more than a day will cause a person to gain the poisoned condition permanently, which can be only cured by magic. This is radiation poisoning caused by decaying radioactive metals used in the construction of the plane. Casting the spell //sickening radiance// in this region will always do maximum damage. Casting heat metal in this area will do no damage but decreases the duration that this part of the mountain is radioactive by 300 years. Casting Leomund's Tiny hut in this region similarly extends the effect for another 2000 years without the spell having any other effect. There is no foreseeable end to the mountain's radioactivity, especially considering the number of experiments we did to figure out these numbers. This section (Technically two, one on each side of the mountain) is warded by a fairly thick wall of awakened plants who will not stop anyone from travelling into the region but will warn all who wish to enter. The plants are exceptionally elegant and polite. They also claim it is forbidden to eat things from within that area. Eating fruit from this area isn't harmful except in the long run, where over a month of consumption of these fruits, a creature will experience the poisoned condition for up to an hour. This effect is culumative, for each month consuming food from the affected region, another hour of the poisoned condition is added each morning. **Once a creature has been exposed to this region for 48 hours or has spent cumulatively 48 months eating food from that region without recieving magical healing, they die. **Dwarves and Svirfneblin (deep gnomes) are resistant to this affect, as are Earth Genasi and similar earth elementals. Any creature that is resistant to radiant damage is immune to it. Plants do not suffer any negative effects in this region. Undead gain vulnerability to all damage while within this region and only take 1 month per 2 hit die, rounded down, to succumb to its effects even if they are otherwise immune to the poisoned condition. Insect swarms are extremely aggressive in this region as well. A thin sheet of lead, lead glass, or 1 foot of stone or iron can shield someone from this effect. **Upon being noticed by the plants of the area, a Paladin of Silvanus is sent to investigate travellers.**


**Magic.** The area around the mountain is a low density magical field, and wild magic surges are rare (being a d10 instead of a d4). Any Magic with an effect (but not damage) determined by a dice, such as confusion, will have the same result every turn the spell is active or every time the spell is cast within each hour (such as chaos bolt). Damage remains the same. Creatures have advantage on saving throws against any divination magic, Scrying near the mountain is difficult and distorted, and rolling for the //Teleport// spell acts as one layer of familiarty lower. False destinations will always result in a mishap

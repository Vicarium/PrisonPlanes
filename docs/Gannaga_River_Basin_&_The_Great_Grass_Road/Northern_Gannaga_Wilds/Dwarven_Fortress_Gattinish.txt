Created Tuesday 06 March 2018

**As of 5854, Gattinish is in the process of being established as a small town and military outpost of Skalmirthon. It sees a great boost to its population from the Manahararahi Diaspora **


==== Gattinish, Panthertraded ====
Tucked into the Wall of a Rather gently sloped valley,  partially hidden by hillocks, are the entrances to Panthertraded. Sealed After the last horde of Goblins attacked it, it has lain dormant after its last residents left. The Trading post, tower, and yet sandy footpaths of the Dwarves that once dwelled there are all that would catch an eye that wasn't looking. Investigating the area reveals an abandoned (and cleared out tavern) that connects underground to a dead end, a Thick and well carved wall impedes further travel. Also such walls can be found behind the trading post, and on top of the hill in a trench. Near the bottom of the valley another footpath leads to an open door and the only unsealed entrance to Gattinish, Why only this one
	* Dm's note: This is the trap Corridor marked on the Gattinish Map.
	* Gattinish is home to Rutherers (The stats of an elephant but with a multiattack bite)

	* Gattinish is also home to blind giant cave swallows(giant eagle) which will harass any member of the party that isn't a dwarf or small, which they will occasionally perch on. If any member of the party is tiny, they will likely attack.

Mersethdatan is a small but profitable dungeon, It is filled to the brim with treasure, as craftsdwarfs worked tirelessly to improve their own lives. Many things are embedded with gems, carved with ornate work, and masterfully made to start with. Many things are made from valuable materials, Marble, Microcline, and Silver among them. The value of these items is high but somewhat dwarfed by their Encumberance. Almost all furniture is made of stone and worked with Dwarven Quantum Magic.

Unfortunately the dwarves were overcome by things that arose from the deep. Forgotten beasts are one among many dark things that derive their home

Forgotten beast Gohplarn: eyeless canine with a bloated body

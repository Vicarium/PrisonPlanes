====== Bregigh ======



===== Description: =====
	A small tribal community of northern native folk often described as "Spiritual and Shamanistic Vikings". They are quite reclusive, yet are always welcoming to foreigners and travelling traders, seeking to trade stories, wisdom, or goods.


===== Urban: =====
	Bregigh is a peaceful town of just under a thousand people right along the coastline of North-Eastern Snarl. They boast some of, if not THE best hunters and gatherers in the land. They are resilient in their survival against the chilly northern environment. Everyone in Bregigh helps each other as best as possible, as they view themselves as a large community of close families and friends (most folk know each other on a first-name basis). The town is built on sacred burial grounds, and disrespecting the dead is considered a massive insult to Bregigh's way of life. 
	Religious Beliefs and Faith are an oddity in Bregigh; rather than follow and worship the normal gods like everyone else, they believe and focus on showing respect to the land itself (by taking only what they need), the Spirits of the world (often major components of what comprises the world; Wind, Water, Land, Fire, Stone, Bone, Blood, Stars, Life, Death, Peace, War, etc.), and communing with the spirits of the dead to gain wisdom through insight, gain strength from their support, and pay homage and respects to the bloodline. (**Dm Note:** //isn't uncommon seeing the ghostly spirit of a deceased townsfolk walking through town, or sitting down having an in depth conversation with someone. While these spirits are technically undead apparitions, don't confuse them for hostile specters; they are peaceful, want to educate from their experiences from their time alive, and stay in touch with their town's culture. If you ever need to communicate with someone in particular, you can always try going to Bregigh's Crypts and doing a ritual by their remains. They are considered just as much townsfolk as the corporeal townspeople.)//
	The townsfolk are mostly comprised of humans and goliaths (most humans have had a little bit of goliath in their bloodline at some point). While everyone has a background that best suits their role in the community (Example: the Oracle has an acolyte background, the fishermen have a sailor background, etc), if push comes to shove, ALL townsfolk have some sort of combat training and can hold their own in battle. (DM Note: All the townsfolk are at least level 5, taking levels in ranger, barbarian, or both. The only exceptions are the Council members, who are a minimum level 11; see below for level composition.)
	Housing in Bregigh is similar to, but a little more advanced than that of Icelandic Vikings; one or two stories, stone and wood walls, wooden doors with brass hinges/doorknobs, insulated with straw and mud/clay, with heavy straw /grass sodded roofing. Most houses have a chimney, topped with a special cover that prevents rain from entering, while still letting smoke out. A houses plot of land is surrounded by a 4 foot tall stone wall, with a small wooden gate to let people in. Bigger families live in houses built directly into the side of a large rolling hill, as this allows more room to be added as needed. The sewage of the town is disposed of into the nearby ocean.
	A lot of arts and craft are found within the town; even their weapons and hunting knives usually have some sort of bauble or d√©cor attached. Most tell stories of the Spirits, previous townsfolk's accomplishments, or Bregigh's culture. They love music too, often singing shanties, jigs, or just playing their percussion-dominated songs (Tribal Drum Circles!)


===== Environment: =====
	The area of Bregigh, being as north as it is, AND on the coast next to a major cold current, can sometimes get quite chilly. During the spring/summer time, temperatures float in the 5 to 15 degrees Celsius, fall time floats in the area of -5 to 5 degrees Celsius, and winter comes in at a brisk -20 to 0 degrees Celsius. Rain is not uncommon, raining on average 1-2 days a week. There has only ever been one Tidal Wave in Bregigh's history (the story apparently involves an expert hunter pissing off a Kraken). 


===== Food: =====
The people of Bregigh are excellent trappers, seasoned farmers, and skilled fishermen; because of this they have a wide variety of simple food providing all the nourishment needed.
	- The trappers, depending on season, get everything from rabbit, boar, bear, deer, and even the occasional fox or lynx. They then immediately cook what they need, and cure or freeze the remainder, as to not waste any meat. (The pelts, claws, bones, and fat are all used for other crafts and needs). The younger hunters follow on these trips and are responsible for gathering fungi, herbs, berries, and fruits used for seasoning, medicinal usage, or jelly/jams.
	- The farmers use the warmer weather of the late spring and summer to grow a variety of vegetables (Potatoes, leek, cabbage, carrot, tomato, onions, mushrooms, barley, oats, rye, and wheat) used for various stews and alcohols. During the colder seasons they tend to the animals they keep (Chicken, cattle, sheep, pig, horses, and goats).
	- The fishermen are out year round off the coast, hauling in loads of whatever fish is in season. Closer to home, and to shore, some townsfolk set up traps for lobsters, and hunt for oysters.
	
	

===== Fashion: =====
	Most clothing in Bregigh is more focused on function over form. Almost all is made of various furs, leathers, and pelts, often decorated with bones; either woven in for extra durability, or added afterwards to display a person's hunting skills, and to add the "spiritual vigor" of the animal. 


===== Ecology: =====
	The heavily wooded and sometimes rocky area around Bregigh has a variety of tree type; everything from Balsam Fir (the most common), Tamarack, Black Spruce, Red and White Pine, to the more rarely seen Choke Cherry and Jack Pine. In the warmer seasons, swamps are not uncommon to come across. Besides the sea water at the coastline, a few freshwater lakes and ponds are scattered throughout the area as well (providing as great backup water supply in the case there are complications with some of their wells). Plenty of wildlife roams the area, and the fish are plentiful, as the townsfolk do their best to only kill and fish what they need. Herbs and Spices grown in town, and found in the wild nearby include; mint, sage, basil, cave-moss, rosemary, black pepper, and cinnamon.


===== Economy: =====
	Bregigh is considered old-fashioned by other larger cities and kingdoms, as they much rather trade goods for other goods, rather than deal with currencies. That being said, it's not to say the few shopkeepers in town don't have money; they have some at all times if by chance a travelling trader or adventurer has some goods they want to sell instead of trading. 


===== Political/Leadership: =====

Bregigh have a council of seven of the wisest members of the town in place to vote on topics, each being a sole represent of a major component of their town's culture. These include; Resource Management (Ranger 9/ Druid 2) (responsible for their stocks of food, and supplies in general), Foreign Affairs (Bard 6/Barbarian 5) (responsible for outside influence from other kingdoms and travellers), The Oracle (Cleric 13 /Druid 2) (responsible for representing the voices of the spirits of their culture), Voice of the Past (Cleric 11) (responsible for communing with the deceased council members for their wisdom of the past), The Wildspeaker (Druid 13) (responsible for representing the voice of the local wildlife and plantlife (usually a druid)), The Ragetongue (Barbarian 14) (responsible for any combat-related matters), and lastly, The Chief (Ranger 3/ Barbarian 11) (responsible for representing the townsfolk, and what is best for them).

===== Notable Events: =====

	-Council Induction: the swearing in of a new council member is celebrated by the town as a whole, not only for the excitement of things to come of this new member, but to reflect on the accomplishments and contributions of the previous member. An evening feast is held, followed by music, dancing, ale, and a peace-pipe.
	-New Birth: the birth of a new child results in the town coming together to pay homage to the newborn over a mid-day feast, followed by the Oracle blessing the child on behalf of the Spirits, and the ceremony concluding with a gift-giving ceremony.
	-Day of Rest: every 14th day is a day of rest, where the townsfolk take from mid-day to midnight to relax, spend time with each other, burn some incense, and offer some thanks to the Spirits.
	-Ancestor's Day: Once a year, during the middle of Fall, the people of Bregigh get together in the evening to pay homage to their ancestors. Rituals to talk to them and gain their advice and wisdom occur.
	-Axe Throwing while enjoying ale is a common hobby, and on the 1st day of each month, a small competition is held mid-day. Winner gets the rights to use the Blade of Bregigh (+2 adamantine one-handed axe, handle made from a Kraken skull) for the month to help with their tasks. The previous winner CAN NOT compete in the following month's competition, and various fail-safes are in place to return the Bite back to its resting place in the Council's Hut after the month has passed. (DM NOTE: Fail-safes are hidden behind Nystul's Magic Aura. On the off-chance someone keeps it longer than one month, they are then subject to a curse of DM's choice.)

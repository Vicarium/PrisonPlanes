====== Quire ======
Created Thursday 07 March 2019

	Previously another satellite of Konia, Quire Declared independance during the war of ants to avoid fighting a war on two fronts. Quire sits in the far northern regions of Konia's territory and is the primary supplier of the fortress at Clayman's point, which acts to interfere with Kholirahi travel around the north-eastern arm of the Aegis mountain rages. Quire established a monarchy rather quickly though they have worked hard to supress the idea of a democracy. Their dominant source of food are hardy grains like oats as well as meat from sheep and chickens. The kingdom aesthetically is very stereotypical of medieval europe and lacks an electrical grid entirely

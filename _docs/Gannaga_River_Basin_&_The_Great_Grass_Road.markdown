Created Wednesday 14 February 2018

The Gannaga River Basin is the second largest river system on the plane, spanning from the south foothills of the Aegis mountains all the way into the Eastern ocean. Several Distributaries fall underneath the sands of Kavir-e Namak, and end up reappearing in Drakenhearth and in a few places along the Dragon Coast.

Those who travel the Gannaga usually seek Danzuishan, Skalmirthon, or Manaharamu, or any of the towns in the protection thereof.

# Footman Fighter
Created Tuesday 18 February 2020

Those who become a footman are usually runners, gophers, messengers, or waiters for powerful beings. Sometimes these people intended to be full-blown warlocks but failed, sometimes they just do side-jobs for the mystical and potent creatures that can teach these secrets. Sometimes they find eldrtich knowledge written on the back of the reciept. Well you've got it now. On Occasion, you might be contacted by another entity to do a job or for information, or you might figure out something new while using this power on your own. One way or another you've got a system that aids you in gaining power

**3rd level: Half-Baked Patron (Or maybe you only half payed attention)**
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you manifest powers earned through complying with the will of an otherworldly patron, or at least that's what you tell people. Choose a half-baked patron from the list below, one that best matches the description of what sort of powers you obtained. You are granted knowledge matching your patron to help you in battle.

**Patron:**
Feyish-  Resistance Bludgeoning Damage
Fiendlike - Resistance Slashing Damage
Eldritchesque - Ignore resistance to bludgeoning, immunity becomes resistance instead 
Celest-y - Ignore resistance to piercing, immunity becomes resistance instead
Somewhat edgy -  Ignore resistance to slashing, immunity becomes resistance instead
Hard-to-kill - Resistance Piercing Damage

**Pact Magic.**
Along with your increased combat effectiveness, you have gleaned some spellcasting knowledge. Great wheels turn inside your mind, granting you access to the twisting energies of the cosmos. If only you could figure out how to turn turn them faster.  At 3rd level you  gain access to  Pact Magic
	
**Cantrips. **
You know one cantrip from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at 10th and 18th level. You can change out which cantrips you know whenever you gain a level in this class
		
**Spell slots. **
You have one first level warlock spell slot. You get an extra warlock spell slot once you reach 10th level in this class and another at 18th. When you reach 10th level your warlock spell slots all become second level, and at 18th level in this class, your slots all become third level. If you already have the pact magic feature, your warlock spell slots have a level equal to the highest level granted by either class. You regain all expended warlock spell slots when you finish either a **short** or a long rest.
		
**Spells known. **
You know a number of warlock spells equal to half your fighter level, rounded down. You can replace one warlock spell that you know with another warlock spell that you have the spell slots for when you gain a level in this class
		
**Eldritch Invocations.**
As a side-effect of your knowledge, you learn one Warlock invocation of your choice. All prerequisites for an invocation must be met, which is a shame because you're certain if you could figure out what "pact of the blade" was, you'd have a great time. Maybe you should contact an actual patron? You can replace an invocation you have with another invocation that you could learn at that level whenever you gain a level in this class. At 7th level you can know 2 invocations at a time, and at 15th you can learn 3.
	
**Spellcasting ability. **
Your choice of either Charisma or intelligence becomes your spellcasting ability modifier. Spell Save = 8  + Proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier




**Taunt:**
At 7th level, your burgeoning will becomes extraordinarily Infuriating. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Deception or Intimidation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by a hostile creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, Though you need not share a language. If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. If the target attacks a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against it. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart. 

**Footwork:**
You think you're getting the hang of this Magic thing. You've learned how to do a trick with your magic and your movement. Going fast feels pretty good. At 10th level, You learn how to do one of the following footwork options. You can use your footwork a number of times equal to your charisma or intelligence modifier and you regain all expended uses on a short or long rest. When you gain a level in this class, you can change which one you know.

**Lockstep:** As a reaction You and one ally within 5ft of you can move a number of feet equal to your move speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks

**Vulnostep**: As an bonus action on your turn, You can move up to your speed, Areas where you walk become engulfed in Mystical Energy. A creature entering an area for the first time on a turn or ending its turn there takes damage of a type of your choice equal to your charisma or intelligence modifier. This path of energy lasts until the end of your next turn. For the next minute, as a bonus action, you can maintain this effect, with new energy erupting where you walk and fading at the end of your next turn (though you don't get the movement again).

**Rumorstep**: as a bonus action on your turn teleport up to half your move speed to a space you can see, at the same time place an illusory duplicate of yourself somewhere within the same range, and one where you had been previously. A creature can use its action to make an intelligence check to determine if a copy is an illusion or not. These duplicates last for a minute or until it is hit (use your AC)

**Doublestep**: As a bonus action on your turn, you conjure an illusory duplicate of yourself where you are standing. Illusory duplicate has a move speed equal to yours. If you take the attack action on your turn, you may forgo one or more of your attacks to allow your duplicate to make them instead.  The Duplicate lasts For a Minute or until it is attacked

**Edgewalker**: As a bonus action on your turn you may move up to your movement speed. Any enemy who deals damage to you while you are moving this turn takes an equal amount of damage of the damage type of your choice. 

**Otherstep**: As a Bonus action on your turn, you may move up to your movement speed. Within the next minute, if an enemy hits you with an attack or you fail a saving throw, then you may use your reaction to teleport back to where you first used this power, moving you before the effects of the attack or saving throw would occur and the ability ends when you teleport back. If you are still in the area affected by the ability that forced you to make a saving throw or in the same space as you were when you were attacked, then you take the effects as normal. While this ability is active, an illusory duplicate of yourself remains where you started, watching and judging you. If any enemy attacks the illusory duplicate while this abillity is active, it ends. (hits)

**Persistent Source.**
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative, if you have no uses of your footwork remaining, you regain 1 use.

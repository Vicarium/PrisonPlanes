# Fey Magic Sorcery
Created Wednesday 19 February 2020

Your innate magic is tied to the feywild. To Dreams, Strong Emotions, Memories and bonds. Perhaps you wandered too long in Tir Na Nog, Perhaps you were owed a favour by a powerful fey, perhaps you *are* fey, Perhaps your charm won you a kiss from a sweet looking person at a social gathering and you woke up the next morning floating above your bed with a silver coin sewn into your skin. It's better than having your eyes turned to stone at least. 

**Spring Within.**
You tap into your eld powers. You no longer need to sleep and can no longer be put to sleep magically. When you rest, you may instead disappear and spend your time in the dreams of another creature for 4 hours, during which you are conscious and aware of your surroundings as well as of the dream, though nothing in the dream can affect you. A creature that remembers its dreams might remember your presence in them. If their sleep is interrupted, you quietly appear in the nearest unoccupied space. If you sleep normally you find your dreams extremely wild, vivid, and filled with fey creatures. If you ever meet any of these fey creatures they can confirm the dream's occurence. You also speak, read, and write sylvan (and also gaelic, but the difference is subtle). 

**Talespinning.**
All fey are moved by stories, tales, and art of all types. Starting at 1st level, your sway with these sorts of things can shape your magic. When your spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or sorcerer spell of the 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the bard spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. In addition, choose a theme for your tales. Lore, Valor, Glamour, Swords, or Whispers. You learn an additional spell based on that theme as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the bard list.
	
Lore 	--- 	Identify (a reminder that Sorcerers don't have ritual casting)
Valor	--- 	Heroism
Glamour --- 	Command 
Swords 	---	Longstrider
Whispers ---	Disguise self
Terror 	---	Dissonant Whispers
	
 In Addition, your Talespinning grants you additional ways to cast your spells

Lore 	---  You become proficient in an artisan's tool kit of your choice. You can use it as a focus for casting your sorcerer spells
Valor	--- You become proficient in a Musical instrument of your choice. You can use it as a focus for casting sorcerer spells.
Glamour --- You become proficient in Perfomance and Acrobatics if you are not already. You can use incredible dance moves in place of a casting focus for your sorcerer spells.
Swords 	--- You become proficient in a single type melee weapon of your choice, and can use it as a casting focus for your sorcerer spells
Whispers --- You become proficient in a gaming set of your choice and can use it as a casting focus for your sorcerer spells.
Terror 	--- You become proficient in animal handling and can use a creature you are mounted on as a casting focus for your sorcerer spells. Yes you read that correctly, it's not any **less** conspicuous than a staff
	



**The Show Must Go On.**
Starting at 6th level, the fey energy thrumming within you empowers you illusions and enchantments. If a creature rolls to beat a your spell save DC for an Illusion or Enchantment spell that you cast, you may spend one sorcery point to give them disadvantage.

**Twillight Image**
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to curse a target with your presence. As a reaction on the opponent's turn, you can teleport to a location that they can see within 60ft of them. If they are unable to see naturally, then you cannot use this feature on that target. If they were blinded throughout their life or simply closing their eyes, then they can still see you as if you are standing in bright light where you are. While this effect is active you cannot lose line of sight to the target, they gain no benefit from Concealment or invisibility. Even if they have full cover, you can see though that cover to them. They can also always see you in the same ways. Even if they are not looking in your direction. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. You can spend one sorcery point to extend the time to one hour, or two sorcery points to reach the maximum of 8 hours.
	 
**Master of the court**
As the feywild is the essence of powerful emotions, you can place them where they were not, twisting a being with your mastery of the world. Starting at 18th level You ignore other creatures' resistances and immunities to charmed and frightened effects.

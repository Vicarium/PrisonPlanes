**I am uncertain what plane this whole thing started on but I can tell you who lived there.**

**Nek Uiji**
A storm giant Divination wizard with some warlock knowledge, no patron.

**Treysa**
 The Great White World Tree ([+World_Trees](./Deep_Lore/World_Trees.markdown)) whose roots can hold worlds together, whose branches elicit serenity and whose machinations are many

**Gramot, an Azer and crafter without peer;** 
**Thenagarurokamon, a Bronze Dragon with secret magic;**
 **Duparatham Ka, a Dao with great resources;**
  **and the unspoken Necromancer, who we have since divined was named "David"**.

# Ushlubarel River Basin
Created Saturday 22 February 2020

The Valley of the aegis mountains. Where orcus landed with a world-shattering step. Here, three great curses were laid here, issued from the great maw of the foul demon. The curses were on the land, on the gods that came here, and the last one was on orcus himself when he realized what it was he was likely to unleash. Anathema to his quiet universe. Teruna, the Demon that keeps things alive and screaming.

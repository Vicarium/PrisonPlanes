A Wizard town, Founded by one of the previous heads of divination in 5844 on the dry and temperate coast of Monteblanca. It sits on a very small leyline in comparison to other magical civilizations but there are interesting opportunities in studying Magical vortices caused by the Danzuishanese maze.
